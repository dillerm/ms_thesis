According to USDA scientist Bruce A. Kimball, \"Based on our results, we believe dogs, as well as mice, could be trained to identify a variety of diseases and health conditions.\u201d The researchers anticipate that their findings could lead to the use of trained disease-detector dogs to screen feces, soil, and other samples as an early-warning system for the emergence and spread of flu viruses. They also hope to identify the specific odor molecules that the mice sense and develop detection instruments for use in the field and in the laboratory.",

		"subsection_content_3": ". There have been six outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in Vietnam since May 5. Two of the outbreaks occurred in Thai Nguyen, two in Dak Lak, one in Quang Nam, and one in Gia Lai. All except for the one in Gia Lai have been resolved. A total of 6,057 birds have been killed by the disease and 4,923 have been culled as a preventative measure. The source of the outbreaks may have been the introduction of new live animals, illegal movement of animals, or contaminated objects. Preventative measures such as quarantine, movement control, disinfection of the premises, and modified stamping out have been put in place.",

The owner reported that he had noticed the death of some chickens awhile ago, but had put off reporting the incident to the Livestock Service. After more chickens died, he reported the case and tests showed that the chickens were infected with bird flu. The Livestock Service has disinfected the area to prevent the spread of the disease.",
