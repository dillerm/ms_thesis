Flu activity worldwide has returned to typical seasonal patterns and furthermore, many people have become immune to the virus. \"The world is no longer in phase 6 of influenza pandemic alert,\" said WHO Director-General Margaret Chan in a press briefing from Hong Kong. \"We are now moving into the post-pandemic period. The H1N1 virus has largely run its course.\" But she cautioned that the virus has not gone away and bears continued watching, \"We expect the H1N1 virus to take on the behavior of a seasonal influenza virus and continue to circulate for some years to come.\" The pandemic had been at a full phase 6 since June 11, 2009. In additional to infecting people in 214 countries and causing at least 18,500 deaths, during the pandemic there were 97 reports of H1N1 flu in animals, most of them domestic. The first report was from a farm in Alberta, Canada, in May 2009, soon after the outbreak was first reported in people in Mexico.
