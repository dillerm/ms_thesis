		"subsection_content_1": "Flu strains that are specific to birds, like highly pathogenic avian influenza or bird flu, rarely cross species but can cause lethal illness in humans. In order to find out which genetic changes allow a flu strain to adapt to a new host, in a study published in the American Journal of Pathology (see citation below) a team led by G\u00fclsah Gabriel looked at two strains of avian influenza, an avian strain that was not adapted for other hosts, and a strain that had adapted to infect mice by mutations in the viral polymerase enzymes. They found that the avian strain only infected the lungs of mice and caused mild symptoms, but the adapted strain infected multiple organs and caused severe illness followed by death. Results indicate that the viral polymerase enzymes may be an important target when treating bird flu in humans. In future studies, the researchers plan to develop drugs that will interfere with virus polymerase activity.",
