		"subsection_content_1": "The poultry industry in Nepal is reporting the closure of thousands of businesses and losses of over 7 billion rupees ($70 million USD) in the poultry sector, due to a recent outbreak of H5N1 in Kathmandu valley and other areas in Nepal. Consumer anxiety over rumors of the bird flu, rather than actual death of poultry, has caused the greatest blow to the poultry market in these areas. Businesspersons are predicting that with the poultry sector contributing nearly 4 percent of Nepal\u2019s GDP, these losses will create a significant deficit in the country\u2019s economy.",
		"subsection_content_4": ".  Italian health officials have confirmed that a male poultry worker has tested positive for H7N7. Transmission occurred when the worker was exposed to sick poultry while working in contaminated areas. As result of his infection, the worker has contracted conjunctivitis. Italian authorities have culled thousands of birds since the emergence of H7N7 on local farms in August. This recent outbreak is the first in Italian poultry since 2000. Authorities have enacted protection and surveillance zones around the affected farms. Other control measures include movement restrictions on poultry products and ongoing veterinary checks.",

		"subsection_content_3": ".  According to a report submitted by researchers from South Korea and Hanoi, regional trade and wild birds are responsible for the recent spread of the low pathogenic avian influenza virus to Vietnamese domestic ducks. Between November 2011 and March 2012, researchers identified a total of 196 isolated cases. A total of 57 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses were identified primarily from domestic ducks located in different regions of Vietnam. The research noted a range of various subtypes of LPAI viruses: H3 (n=16), H4 (n=4), H6 (n=24), H7 (n=1) and H9 (n=10). The research concluded that further surveillance is necessary to fully understand and properly react to these unique avian influenza viruses and their epidemiology.",
