	"content_1": "According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development’s Animal Health Department, the highly pathogenic A/H5N6 bird flu virus was detected in a flock of pheasants in the northern province of Lao Cai’s Bao Thang District.  498 birds out of a flock of 558 died and the rest were destroyed.  In order to prevent bird flu from spreading, local authorities have taken measures such as strict quarantine regulations and inspections of poultry transport and trading.  The strain was first detected in Vietnam in mid-August in chickens in the province of Lang Son and in a flock of ducks in the province of Ha Tinh. The source of the introduction of the H5N6 virus into Vietnam is thought to be either smuggling or wild bird migration."
