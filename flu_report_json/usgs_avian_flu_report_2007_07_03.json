The  Undersecretary of Agriculture was reported as having said that the virus  isolated in Nuremberg is more than 99% identical to the virus isolated from the  Czech Republic and there was a high probability that H5N1 was introduced into  Germany by the poultry trade.

The reservoir is said to be one of the  \u201cmost risky areas\u201d through which many wild birds move, \u201cbut from the veterinary  point of view it is a rather good locality as there are no big bird farms  around,\u201d Salava said.
