	"content_1": "A recent study led by Donata Kalthoff (see citation below) looked at the relationship between migration and susceptibility to HPAIV H5N1 bird flu.  Researchers experimentally infected with the virus (a) strongly migrating, (b) weakly migrating, and (c) non-migrating populations of stonechats, an insectivorous species of passerine. They conducted the experiment in autumn when the migratory stonechats exhibit restlessness indicative of migratory predisposition. All three groups of birds succumbed to the disease within 3 to 7 days of infection and showed no difference in viral shedding, antigen distribution, or survival time. Epithelial tropism, a phenomenon in which the virus preferentially attacks the tissue inside of blood vessels, was seen only in the resident group of birds. The study concludes that this group of insectivorous passerines is highly susceptible to H5N1 bird flu and is therefore likely to play a limited role in its transmission. It noted that despite pronounced inherited differences in migratory status, the groups reacted identically to infection in every respect except for the occurrence of viral tropism."
