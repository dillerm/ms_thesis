Wild bird biologists and park wardens will monitor live and dead wild birds at designated reserves year round for bird flu; however, birds shot during the hunting season will no longer be tested. The changes are based on improved scientific understanding and experience since the Survey began in 2005. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs chief veterinarian, Nigel Gibbens, said the survey will be kept under review and will be updated as necessary.",
		"subsection_content_3": "A 48 year old farmer has died of suspected bird flu.  The man was admitted to the hospital September 29th with a high fever, cough, sore throat, chest pains and difficulty breathing, but died the next day.  He worked on a duck farm in the Pho Prathap Chang district that housed 1,600 free range ducks, many of which had died the previous week.  Suspicious poultry deaths have occurred in other areas of the district as well, and the man's 12 year old son is under observation for working at the same farm as his father.(",
