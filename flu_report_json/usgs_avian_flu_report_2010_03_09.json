The South Korean government announced on February 26 that it will strengthen measures to prevent and combat bird flu in anticipation of migratory birds arriving in the country. Recent outbreaks in other Southeast Asian countries have caused the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to plan ahead in case the virus spreads to local chickens and ducks through the migratory birds. Precautions will include monitoring migratory birds in Heuksan and Hong islands in the Yellow Sea, decontaminating vehicles that carry poultry, and encouraging farmers to implement sterilization procedures twice a week.",

		"subsection_content_2": ". The University of Hong Kong found that one sample taken during regular influenza virus surveillance was primarily a different swine flu strain but had picked up a gene from pandemic H1N1 (2009) by genetic reassortment. This is the first such sample found by the program. The government is monitoring developments, but urges people not to be alarmed as there is no health concern from cooked pork. Scientists are not surprised by this combination of viruses and it is likely that other similar combinations have occurred without being detected. Further tests are underway to determine the characteristics of the strain.",
