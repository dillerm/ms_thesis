This is the third bird flu death in Indonesia this month and brings the total number of human bird flu cases in Indonesia to 109 with 88 deaths. Officials from the Health Ministry said that contact with infected chickens is suspected, but the district health officer, Yulah Iskandar, said the boy did not have contact with dead chickens prior to infection and his family did not keep poultry in their backyard. However, there is a poultry breeding business within 500 m of the house and another report suggests that it was chickens near the school. (",
