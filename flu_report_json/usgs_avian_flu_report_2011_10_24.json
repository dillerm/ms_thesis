	"content_1": ".  Highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks occurred in three separate villages (Penujak , Peringgarata and Semayan) on Lombok Island in Indonesia.  At least 1,900 dead chickens were reported during the outbreaks and samples were sent to laboratories in Mataram and Bali. The Livestock and Animal Health Service confirmed the birds were infected with H5N1 bird flu. The Livestock and Animal Health Service is concerned that unofficial ports on Lombok are importing animals without quarantine inspection, causing the bird flu virus to spread.  However, the exact source of the three outbreaks on Lombok remains unknown.",

	"content_2": ".  In relation to the H5N1 bird flu outbreaks on Lombok Island in Indonesia, four patients continue to be treated for possible bird flu infection at West Nusa Tenggara General Hospital in Central Lombok. Three of the patients are currently recovering, a 5-month-old baby, an 11-month-old boy and 53-year-old man, while the fourth patient, a 10-year-old girl, remains under close observation as she is still exhibiting flu symptoms.  All of the patientsâ€™ preliminary test results were negative for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, but doctors are waiting on further tests from Jakarta before clearing them to leave the hospital.  All of the patients live within one kilometer of each other in Central Lombok, an area that has been experiencing bird flu outbreaks among chickens for the past few weeks."
