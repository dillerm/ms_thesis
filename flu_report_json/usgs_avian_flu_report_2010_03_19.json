The disease has spread to nearly all of the districts and towns in the province and 50% more chickens have died from bird flu than in February of 2009. The head of the province`s animal husbandry office, Hanis Lubis, said on March 12 that this increase was likely caused by a longer rainy season and the local breeders’ habit of throwing dead chickens into rivers instead of burning them. Most of the chickens that have died belonged to local residents, but there have been no reports of human infection so far. Veterinarians have been deployed to infected areas to improve public awareness of the disease and Lubis urges citizens to immediately inform the animal husbandry office if they find large numbers of chickens that have suddenly died. Bird flu remains a problem in all provinces of Indonesia especially during the rainy season.",
