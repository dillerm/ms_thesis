	"content_1": "A study led by Zheng Kou and published in PLoS One (see citation below) found that a surprisingly large number of species of wild birds were affected by highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 and that the prevalence of H5N1, especially in certain species, is high. The researchers analyzed 14,472 wild bird samples covering 56 species in 10 avian orders from 14 Chinese provinces and monitored the prevalence of the H5N1 subtype between April 2004 and August 2007. They found 149 positive samples from 6 avian orders. The mallard had the highest prevalence (4.37%) of the 24 species that tested positive. The highest prevalence of H5N1 was found in Anseriformes (2.7%) and the lowest in Passeriformes (0.36%).  Qinghai province had a higher H5N1 prevalence than the other 13 provinces combined (3.88% versus 0.43%). Sequence analysis of the samples suggested that birds were exposed to a wide range of H5N1 strains in the wild."
