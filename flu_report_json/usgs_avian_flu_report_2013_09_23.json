The District Livestock Office said that it does not need to conduct bird flu tests because since August 15 the government declared Bhaktapur a bird flu crisis-hit zone.  So far, over 720,000 adult fowl and over 275,000 chicks have been culled, and over 1 million eggs and 50,000 kg of chicken feed have been destroyed in an effort to control H5N1 in Nepal."
