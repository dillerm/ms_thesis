	"content_1": "Scientists still debate about the role of wild birds in the spread of H5N1 and a lack of knowledge about bird movements in central Asia has made it difficult to answer the question.  A recent study led by Dr. Diann Prosser set out to document migration of waterfowl in Asian Flyways to improve understanding of H5N1 transmission. They studied migration of waterfowl from Qinghai Lake in China, the site of an H5N1 outbreak in wild birds in 2005, 2006 and most recently in June of this year. Some phylogeny studies had suggested that birds infected in this outbreak could not have spread the virus to Mongolia because no direct migratory connection existed. In 2007, researchers gathered 25 birds from species that had died in the 2005 outbreak and marked them with GPS satellite transmitters. Three of the marked birds migrated to areas near H5N1 outbreak areas in Mongolia, suggesting that there may be a connection between wild migratory birds and the spread of the disease between China and Mongolia.",

	"content_2": "Spain. Low pathogenic H5 bird flu broke out on a farm in Los Arcos, Navarra Province on June 12. None of the 3,625 ducks on the farm showed clinical signs, but the virus was detected by PCR. The N1 subtype was ruled out, but no NA subtype has been determined. The outbreak is ongoing, but the premises have been disinfected to prevent the spread of the disease."
