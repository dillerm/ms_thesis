All 9,043 chickens were destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading further.  The source of the outbreak remains unknown, but the Dutch Ministry believes that \u201cit\u2019s probably a mild H7 version of the bird flu virus\u201d which is not dangerous to humans.  Control measures being applied include stamping out, zoning, and disinfection of contaminated areas.

		"subsection_content_4": "Taiwanese officials recently confirmed an outbreak of H5N2 on a duck farm located in Hualien County. Out of 11,672 birds, 20 cases were confirmed.

		"subsection_content_6": "Chinese scientists have confirmed based on recent evidence that H7N9 can be spread via person to person. The virus has been linked to 132 cases and 37 deaths in China and Taiwan from March to May of this past year. Scientists specifically investigated a case in eastern China where the virus was likely to have spread from a father to his daughter. The father contracted the virus, and was cared for by his daughter, who eventually fell sick and died one month later. The nearly identical H7N9 virus was isolated from both patients. Scientists noted several specific challenges related to the virus, including its ability to go undetected in birds before its transmittal to humans. In response to the outbreak, Chinese authorities applied several control measures to stop its spread, including suspending live markets across the country. With the exception of one single reported case last month, the control measures have been effective in stopping the virus.",
