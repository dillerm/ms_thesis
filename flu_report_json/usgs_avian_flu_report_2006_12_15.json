According to news reports, although there was viral shedding in   inoculated birds, mortality was seen only in sparrows, but not in the starlings   and pigeons. There was no transmission to other birds in all three species.   Webster suggests that keeping small birds such as those tested in these   experiments away from poultry is necessary so they do not carry the virus from   chicken house to chicken house.",

The farmer reported on 12/10/06 to the authorities that   over 1,000 quail died over a 4-day period. The farm raises over 290,000 quail.    Some experts and local farms suspect the disease might have spread along the   major local highway, Route 23, but an unnamed provincial official is quoted in a   Korean news report as saying \u201cQuail are hardy birds, and it seems the infected   birds got the virus from migratory birds at the same time as the poultry in   Iksan and fell ill after the full incubation period of 21 days.\" Before the   movement of poultry from the farm was halted, over 100,000 quail eggs had been   sent to market. Quail eggs are not washed before sale and authorities fear the   fecal contamination might contain virus. Also, 15,000 young quail were sent to a   farm in Koksong, South Cholla on 12/9/06.  No evidence of disease has been   reported at Koksong; 360,000 poultry within 500 m of the Gimje farm will be   culled. So far, over a million birds have been or will be culled in the three   outbreaks this year in South Korea.",
