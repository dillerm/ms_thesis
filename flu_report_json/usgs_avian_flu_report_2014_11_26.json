The virus was detected in a common teal during surveillance of wild birds in the Vorpommern Rugen region. This is the first detection of HPAI H5N8 in wild birds in Europe and lends support to migratory birds as one possible route of introduction. In order to prevent the spread of the disease to poultry, Dr. Till Backhaus, the state√¢??s Minister for Agriculture, the Environment and Consumer Protection, has called for all domestic birds to be kept indoors, and for poultry producers to report any signs of disease and take precautions to keep wild birds away from food, water, and other materials designated for their birds.",
