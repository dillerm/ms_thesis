Some of the outbreaks included reports of neurologic symptoms, torticollis, and ataxia.  The apparent mortality rate was between 1.5 and 3%, and all susceptible animals at all affected farms have been destroyed.  Other control measures include movement control inside the country, screening, disinfection / disinfestation, traceability, quarantine, surveillance outside containment and/or protection zone, stamping out, official destruction of animal products, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, control of wildlife reservoirs, and zoning.",

This is the first record of this strain in France.  On November 17, 25 wild ducks (gadwalls, Anas strepera and Eusasian widgeons, Anas penelope) were found dead: they were part of a flock of 75 which was kept on a private body of water and used as call-ducks by hunters.  On November 26, H5N8 was confirmed in samples taken from the dead ducks.  A group of 35 ducks remained on the body of water after the mortality event; they were slaughtered on November 28.  The outbreak was caused by contact with wild species, and control measures include screening, disinfection/disinfestation, stamping out, and official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste.  Vaccination is prohibited and affected animals are not being treated.  Testing was conducted by the ANSES Reference National Laboratory in Maisons-Alfort.",
		"subsection_content_14": "Four outbreaks of H5N8 have been reported in The Netherlands.  On November 11, HPAI was detected in two dead birds from a hobby flock of black swans in Den Oever, North Holland.  The remainder of the flock was culled, and in total 34 black swans and a wild duck died or were destroyed.  This incident has not triggered any control measures beyond the culling.  During the period of November 26 to December 1, three duck farms in Biddinghuizen, Flevoland Province experienced HPAI H5N8 mortality events.  All susceptible birds at those farms have been culled; in addition, the ducks kept at several farms owned by the same company as one of the affected farms have been culled as a precautionary measure.  Farms near the affected farms have been screened and found negative for AI.  Additional control measures include movement control inside the country, screening, disinfection/disinfestation, stamping out, control of wildlife reservoirs, and zoning.",

On November 30, 100 chickens were found dead on a farm in Joetsu, Niigata Prefecture; the remaining 230,000 were culled without waiting for confirmation of AI.  H5N8 has been confirmed. AI is suspected due to recent confirmed outbreaks in nearby areas.
