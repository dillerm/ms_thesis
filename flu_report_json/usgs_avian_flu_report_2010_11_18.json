According to a November 18 statement by Secretary for Food and Health, York Chow, there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission. The patient had recently visited China with her family and ate chicken in a poultry market there, but it is uncertain whether this was the cause of her infection or whether she caught the disease upon her return to Hong Kong on November 1.  She began to show symptoms the next day, and was hospitalized on November 14 with a persistent fever.",
