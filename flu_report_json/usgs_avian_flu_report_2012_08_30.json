Blood samples have been sent to the Regional Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in Belgachia for testing.  Preventive measures include spraying lime and bleaching powder in the area, distributing bird flu informational leaflets, and implementing an awareness campaign  which urges people to wear gloves while feeding poultry and  explains how to dispose of dead poultry carcasses properly.  If the blood samples are found to be positive for avian influenza virus (H5N1), samples will be sent to the National Institute of Virology in Pune for confirmation. Once confirmed, rapid response teams can be deployed within three days to begin culling and initiate death surveillance of poultry.",
