He further  noted that thousands of wild birds have been tested for H5N1 at Mai Po refuge  in the past two years, and none of the free-flying wild birds has tested  positive for H5N1.  It is estimated that between 450,000 and 700,000 birds  are imported each year into Hong Kong, and except for 40,000 to 80,000 that are  checked, the majority are unregulated.",
