Health officials are confirming that a four-year-old boy died of H5N1 on December 6, 2012, after coming in contact with dead, infected fowl near his home in the West Java District of Bogor.  Indonesia has been hit particularly hard with the deadly virus with a total of 160 deaths this year alone.  It is unclear if the boy was infected with the new strain of HPAI H5N1 (clade 2.3.2) that was first found in Indonesia in September of last year, but as of a week ago, Tjandra Yoga Aditama, the director of disease control and public health at the Health Ministry, said that the new clade had not infected any Indonesians at that time.",
