		"subsection_content_1": "The Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management announced on December 16 that about 3,000 harbor seals have died so far this year in Swedish and Danish waters, probably from infection with avian influenza virus H10N7. There have been additional reports of avian influenza-related seal deaths in Norway, Germany and the Netherlands. The virus was first detected in April off the coast of Gothenburg, Sweden, and in October estimates for number of seal deaths were 700. However, mortality estimates are difficult since most of the dead seal carcasses sank. There are about 10,000 seals in Sweden and 12,000 in Denmark. The agency thinks that most Swedish seals have probably been infected by the virus but that the majority developed protective antibodies.",
		"subsection_content_4": "The state of Lower Saxony's agriculture ministry confirmed on December 16 a case of H5N8 avian influenza at a turkey farm in Barssel, Cloppenburg, Lower Saxony (Niedersachsen). Of the 17,887 susceptible birds, there have been 4088 cases, 199 deaths, and the remaining 17,688 birds have been destroyed. Control measures applied include control of wildlife reservoirs, movement control inside the country, screening, zoning, and disinfection of the premises.

		"subsection_content_2": "A total of 17 birds from a small-scale mortality event at Wiser Lake, Whatcom County, Washington have been tested at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC). Four of these birds were positive for H5 avian influenza by RT-PCR, and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N2 and H5N8 have been confirmed in a northern pintail and a gyrfalcon by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories. The captive gyrfalcon had hunted in the same area and fed on a free-living widgeon. That bird subsequently died and the carcass was submitted to NWHC for testing. H5N8 was also identified in three other captive gyrfalcons that had died/euthanized after feeding on the same widgeon. These birds were examined at the Washington Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory. The widgeon remains are being tested by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories to confirm that it carried the virus that infected the gyrfalcons. The northern pintail was among the mallards, American widgeon, northern shoveler, and trumpeter swan and other waterfowl that died in the area. The pintail was collected by the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife after a die-off of 50 to 100 birds at Wiser Lake. Wiser Lake has a history of aspergillosis and lead poisoning. Aspergillosis was present in at least five of the birds thus far, but the northern pintail was also infected with HPAI H5N2.",
