Avian influenza is estimated to have killed over half a million  chickens in Jakarta over the last six months and not all outbreaks were  reported to the health authorities, according to the Jakarta Post. The estimate  was from a survey of 10 farmers with between 100-200 chickens each in Jakarta,  Tangrang, Bogor and Bekasi. \"Chickens die everywhere. The problem is the  deaths are not always reported,\" Heru Setjanto, Bogot Institute of  Agriculture said. Part of the problem is the lack of field officers who can  receive the outbreak reports. Indonesia has only 200 animal health posts across  the country and in nearly half of the posts are not functioning due to the lack  of veterinarians.",
