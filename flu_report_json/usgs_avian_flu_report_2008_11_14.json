Her doctor and a member of the hospital's avian influenza team, Agus Suryanto, said the girl died of respiratory failure and a high (39\u00baC) fever after 10 days of hospitalization. \"There was a chance that she got infected by bird flu as she had been living nearby a chicken abattoir,\" Agus said. Tatik Suryanti, the local health agency chief, said that tests at two laboratories have confirmed the girl had H5N1. However, the case is officially being denied by the Health Minister, Siti Fadilah Supari, who says \"Both of the laboratory tests showed that she was negative of bird flu, so the total death toll (of bird flu) remains 112.\" The disagreement highlights the continued dispute between Indonesia and the World Health Organization over the sharing of influenza samples.",
