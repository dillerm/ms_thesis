He developed symptoms on   December 10, 2006, was admitted to the hospital on December 17, and was   discharged on January 6, 2007, having fully recovered.  An initial test for H5N1   was negative, but H5N1 was detected on a second test and the results were   immediately shared with the WHO.  Henk Bekedam, WHO\u2019s China representative,   noted that while there were no known H5N1 outbreaks in poultry where the man   lived, it was possible for the farmer\u2019s birds to be infected with H5N1 and not   show any symptoms because improvements in poultry vaccination rates in China   could make it more difficult for authorities to detect a circulating virus.   China\u2019s last reported human case was from July 2006 in the Xinjiang Uygur   Autonomous Region in the northwest.",

The   bird was one of five found dead on New Year\u2019s Eve in Causeway Bay, a commercial   district in Hong Kong.  The scaly-breasted munia is not typically an urban bird,   prompting suggestions that it was either a pet bird released because it was ill   or that the bird was released as part of the practice of \"merit release,\" the   Buddhist custom of releasing wild animals as good deeds.  It is estimated that   over 38,000 munias are imported into Hong Kong each year, most originating from   China.",
