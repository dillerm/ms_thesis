From April to June of this year, six countries, Bangladesh, Cambodia, China, Egypt, India, and Indonesia, reported 98 domestic poultry outbreaks and 5 wild bird outbreaks, compared to 508 outbreaks during the same time last year.  While the decline is good news, the FAO cautions that \u201cnot all outbreaks are reported, making it difficult to tell if the world has actually made progress in H5N1 control.\u201d  The report also confirmed that during the second quarter, nine human cases of the H5N1 have been reported in Cambodia, China, Egypt, and Indonesia.",

Because the virus is low-pathogenic, the 15,700 chickens will not be culled; rather, they will be monitored and the eggs will be disinfected before being sold.  All poultry farms within a 3-kilometer radius are being monitored for further outbreaks.",
