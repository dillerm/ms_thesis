		"subsection_content_1": "Brazil. A virology team led by Terezinha Maria de Pavia at the Instituto Adolfo Lutz discovered what they believe to be a new H1N1 virus mutation in a 26-year-old patient from Brazil. They named the strain A/Sao Paulo/1454/H1N1. Brazilian scientists believed that the isolate may represent a novel strain of H1N1 as a number of mutations in the hemagglutinin protein was detected, but analysis at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center and elsewhere did not confirm the new strain (A/Sao Paulo/1454/H1N1) as a new virus. The hemagglutinin and matrix RNA segments are identical in sequence to other isolates from the US, Greece and Japan, among others. Hemagglutinin is involved in the infection of hosts by mediating binding to cell surface receptors and so a change in its structure could make the disease more infectious. Efforts to create a vaccine for H1N1 continue.",
