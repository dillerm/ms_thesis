A government panel of scientists concluded that the first bird flu outbreak in a commercial poultry farm in six years in Hong Kong in Dec. 2007 was \"most likely to have been introduced to the farm by wild birds.\" The virus present in droppings, could have been blown by a gust of wind into the farm, or tracked in on contaminated clothing of farm workers or even by other animals such as rodents, the scientists say.",

Three birds from a backyard flock also died in the outbreak. Another commercial farm in Dhaka experienced an outbreak beginning on Feb. 16; 268 birds died and 1,182 were destroyed. A third outbreak on a commercial farm in Dhaka that began on Feb. 19 caused the death of 40 birds and the culling of 460. Since March 2007 around 570 farms, 50 of them backyard, have reported cases of bird flu. Although authorities are confident that this year will be better than last, scientists are concerned that backyard farms will be particularly at risk because owners are not well informed about preventative measures. Cases of bird flu in backyard farms often go unreported and pose a health threat to humans as well as poultry.Japan. H7N6 avian influenza was detected on a quail farm in Toyohashi, Aichi prefecture. Seven quail tested positive during a routine inspection of the 320,000-bird farm. None of the birds have died from the disease, which suggests a low-pathogenic strain. 260,000 birds will be culled and composted to prevent the disease from spreading. On March 4, H7 was discovered at a second quail farm located less than 5 km from the farm where the outbreak began. An additional 5 km movement restriction area has been established around the second farm."
