All of the seized birds were euthanized and then \r\n\t\t\t\t    incinerated, officials said. Authorities are also tracing other birds \r\n\t\t\t\t    that might have been smuggled at the same time. This led the  secretary \r\n\t\t\t\t    of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to remind the \r\n\t\t\t\t    public about the danger of importing birds from Indonesia. The \r\n\t\t\t\t    Philippines remains the only country in the area to be free of bird-flu and has been especially vigilant as to the legal and illegal importation  of poultry and wild birds.",

	"content_2": ". In reports from July 17, 2007, antibodies to H5 have been found in 50 \r\n\t\t\t\t    out of 4,000 wild bird samples taken this year from five regions in \r\n\t\t\t\t    Siberia. None of the six million poultry in the high risk areas have \r\n\t\t\t\t    been affected. According to the spokesman of the local veterinary \r\n\t\t\t\t    authority, “the presence of antibodies meant that either the birds had \r\n\t\t\t\t    survived avian influenza, or remained infected but it had not spread in \r\n\t\t\t\t    an open form, and could be transmitted to other birds.” (more...)"
