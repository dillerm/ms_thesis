The remaining birds were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. The origin of the outbreak is unknown, but preventative measures such as stamping out, movement control within the country, and disinfection of the premises have been put in place.

		"subsection_content_5": ". On December 31, South Korea reported the first outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in domestic poultry in two years. Two poultry farms in South Jeolla province and Chungcheong province first detected bird flu on December 29 as birds began to die off. Together the farms contained a total of 27,850 chickens and ducks. Both farms have been placed under quarantine with authorities moving to cull and bury their ducks and chickens to prevent the disease from spreading. Quarantine officials had stepped up inspections on wild birds and urged poultry businesses to take extra precautions, like setting up nets around their farms to keep out wild birds, after wild birds were confirmed to have the disease earlier in the month. More than 100,000 birds have been slaughtered in efforts to contain the disease and health authorities placed a quarantine zone over a 10 km (6.25 mile) radius, restricting movements of vehicles and people and carrying out emergency disinfection. The latest confirmation effectively ends South Korea's bird flu-free status and will halt exports of chickens, ducks and related products. The bird flu outbreak is likely to further strain the country's health system, which has been struggling to contain swine flu and foot-and-mouth disease cases across the country.",
