		"subsection_content_3": "The World Health Organization and the Cambodian Health Ministry released a joint statement confirming the death on October 26 of a two-year-old girl from northwestern Pursat Province. Her death brings the total number of H5N1 cases reported in Cambodia in 2013 to 23. Out of 23 cases, only 11 have survived the virus. Investigators said that two months prior to the girl\u2019s illness, poultry at her grandparent\u2019s house, where she often stayed, unexpectedly died. Investigators are attempting to determine whether contact occurred between the girl and the dead chickens. This is Cambodia\u2019s worst outbreak of H5N1 to date since its presence was first discovered in Cambodia in 2004. Cambodia has had 44 documented human cases total, and of that total, 31 have died as a result.",
