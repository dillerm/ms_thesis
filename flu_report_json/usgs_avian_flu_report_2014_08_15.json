In a report to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) on August 12, the department stated there were 15 deaths and the remaining 1965 birds were destroyed.  Samples were also taken from surrounding poultry flocks, but all were negative for avian influenza.  This is the first time the virus has been found in Vietnam. The source of the outbreak is still unknown but genetic analysis of samples taken from infected poultry shows that the strain is 99 percent identical to the strain that killed a 49-year-old man in the Chinese province of Sichuan in April this year.",
