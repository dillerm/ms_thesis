Two captive ducks (decoys) used for luring wild ducks into a hunting area tested positive for LPAI H5N1. These two were from a group of ten that were tested from a premises housing 45 ducks in Calvados. Additionally, two other decoy ducks from a site in Pas-de Calais (where 563 ducks are kept) tested positive for H5 (not N1) during routine testing. Both sites have been placed under surveillance and have increased biosecurity, but affected birds were not culled. Indonesia. The Indonesian Institute of Science (LIPI) revealed on March 23 that at least 63% of native chickens are resistant to bird flu because of a gene called Mx. According to researcher Sri Sulandari, “The indigenous chickens’ ability to resist avian influenza varies according to the strength of the antivirus genes in their body.” Japan.  Antibodies to H7 were discovered in some birds in a fourth farm (Farm D) in Aichi Prefecture in Japan. The farm raises 670,000 quails and is located within the 5 km radius of the first farm (Farm A) where LPAI H7N6 virus was discovered at the end of February."
