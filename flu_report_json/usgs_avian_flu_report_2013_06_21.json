Dutch scientists at Wageningen University successfully sequenced the genome of the mallard, which, according to the research team, will \u201cprovide good leads for further research into exactly how this virus (influenza A) affects birds, and in the long-term, also humans.\u201d Humans and mallards share some of the same infection-fighting defense mechanisms, and studying the differences between how mallards and humans fight off infections, specifically influenza, will help scientists \u201cfind ways of controlling the infection process with medication in humans.\u201d",
