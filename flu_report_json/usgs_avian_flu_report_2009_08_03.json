This includes requiring pork slaughter plants to have multiple inspection points to ensure that only healthy animals enter the food supply.

In order to reduce the spread of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus among children, the United Kingdom government has issued guidelines requiring nurseries to remove communal recreational items from their facilities.  This includes teddy bears and other soft toys, crayon and coloring pencils, among other things.  The guidance, which was issued by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, said that these types of toys could not be cleaned adequately, so it was better to remove them.  In addition, nurseries have been required to suspend morning assemblies or any other kind of event that would bring large groups of children together in an enclosed space.",
