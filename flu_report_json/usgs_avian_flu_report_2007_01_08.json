	"content_4": "Vietnam: During the week of December 20, 2006, H5N1 was reported in ducks raised illegally in three locations in two provinces (Ca Mau and Bac Lieu) in the Mekong Delta.  The scale of the situation then repeatedly expanded, first to he adjacent province of Hau Giang, then as of the beginning of 2007 to a total of 25 communities in three. During the same period, cross-border smuggling of poultry continued in the northern provinces bordering China. Over a ton of poultry was seized over the New Year by local authorities in the province of Qang Ninh. The northern smuggling route has frequently been cited as a possible route of introduction of H5N1 into Vietnam. The bird flu situation in Vietnam was further complicated as over 70% of the poultry tested in the central provinces of Quang Nam and Quang Ngai are positive for H5N1."
