		"subsection_content_3": ".  A new study led by the University of Arizona may answer the question as to why the 1918 flu pandemic killed so many young adults.  Their studies show that \u201ca human H1 virus that had been circulating among humans since around 1900 picked up genetic material from a bird flu virus just before 1918 and this became the deadly pandemic strain.\u201d  Additionally, this research may help \u201cexplain differences in patterns of mortality between seasonal flu and the deadly H5N1 and H7N9 bird flu viruses.\u201d  More information about this study can be found in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.",
