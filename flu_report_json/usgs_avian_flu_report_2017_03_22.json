Six new outbreaks were reported between 8 and 16 March; details were not provided for four of the outbreaks, except that three involved H5N2 and one involved H5N8.  The fifth outbreak involved H5N6, and occurred at a duck farm in Hualien County: all 14,647 ducks were culled on 9 March.  40 workers involved in that outbreak are being monitored for signs of avian influenza, and two, who had failed to wear protective gear at work, have been given precautionary antivirals.  The sixth outbreak occurred on 16 March, on a farm in Changhua County; 1,277 ducks were culled.  The COA currently requires ducks to be tested for avian influenza before they can be slaughtered for sale, and H5 avian influenza was detected in ducks from this farm during this routine testing.",
		"subsection_content_4": "Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in Kelantan State, in the northern part of West (Peninsular) Malaysia.  The outbreak was first detected on 6 March, in backyard poultry in a small village; authorities implemented control measures (including culling at least 170 chickens), and initially believed it was contained in that area.  However, the virus has subsequently been detected in at least 20 more villages, and 24,000 birds have been culled in an renewed effort to control the spread of the virus.  Backyard poultry have been affected thus far, but none in commercial farms as of 16 March. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has been known to infect humans in the past (although it is not known to be transmitted well from person to person), and villagers are being screened; so far no human cases have been found.  The source of the outbreak is unknown, but it may have been imported into the area by birds transported for cockfighting.",

In both cases, all susceptible animals have been destroyed (for a total of 734 birds which died or were destroyed at the first farm, and 17,510 at the second).  Control measures include screening, disinfection/disinfestation, traceability, surveillance within and outside containment and/or protection zone, stamping out, official destruction of animal products, carcasses, by-products and waste, and zoning.

The third suspected outbreak involved samples collected as part of a routine surveillance effort; the samples were taken at a flea market in Jackson County on 12 March.  Samples from all three potential outbreaks are currently being tested.  A precautionary Stop Movement Order has been issued by the Alabama State Veterinarian to preclude the possible spread of the disease. The Madison and Jackson county events are reported as LPAI H7N9 but no official USDA statement has been released on them as yet.",

Authorities suspected avian influenza after several birds were found dead, over the course of about a week, in a village children\u2019s park; the virus was confirmed present on 6 March.  The park has been closed for a month as a precaution.  The species involved included a turkey, a peacock, an eagle owl, and a guinea pig; it is unclear whether the birds were free-ranging or kept in enclosures.",

The outbreak was confirmed on 1 March; 6,000 birds died from the disease, and 250,000 will be culled.  Reports are inconclusive, but suggest that there may have been one or two additional outbreaks at other commercial poultry farms in Moscow Oblast.  It is possible that up to 4 million animals may have to be culled to contain the outbreak.  In addition, 14 farm workers have been hospitalized, reportedly with symptoms of avian influenza; however, HPAI H5N8 is not known to infect humans.",
		"subsection_content_1": "Highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza was detected in 21 Dalmatian pelicans at the Schoenbrunn Zoo in Vienna.  The zoo\u2019s pelicans have been kept in a tent since December to prevent infection, but on March 6, one pelican became ill. It was euthanized the same day because of the severity of the disease, and subsequent tests confirmed that it had been infected with HPAI H5N8.  The entire flock was then tested, and all 20 remaining birds were positive for the virus; on March 10, they were also euthanized. Until this happened, the Schoenbrunn Zoo had the world\u2019s largest flock of the endangered Dalmatian pelicans.",

This has been South Korea\u2019s worst season for avian influenza."
