All are ostriches from commercial farms in the area. The cases tested positive on serology during routine surveillance, but tested negative on initial PCR tests and no virus could be found.  Infection was confirmed after several follow-up PCR tests.  At the time of the report, no clinical signs or mortalities had been seen. To control the spread of the virus, the cases have been quarantined and other susceptible birds are being screened for the virus; culling is planned as a further control measure.",

On May 10, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) announced the launch of an EU-funded international networking project that will link thousands of scientists across the world. According to DEFRA, this project will allow scientists to exchange research, establish common goals and collaborate on developing future control measures for major diseases, such as avian flu, which are a cause for global concern. DEFRA said that the project would also serve to underpin early warning systems, by making it easier to detect emerging diseases in foreign countries that could pose a risk to the UK farming industry. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens said in a press release, \u201cGlobal coordination of our animal disease research efforts will help ensure that new technologies, such as diagnostic tools, vaccines and new treatments, are identified and put to work as quickly as possible to make a real difference to the health, welfare and productivity of livestock.\u201d The \u20ac1million network will include Canada, USA, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark and the UK.

The South Korean government recently announced that starting next year, it will reduce compensation to farmers affected by livestock diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza.  The agriculture ministry says that if outbreaks of diseases were brought on by the farmers' negligence, compensation will be cut by up to 80 percent, and under no circumstances will their damages be fully covered. Also, when farm owners do not report the employment of migrant workers or fail to sterilize the area thoroughly enough to prevent animal diseases, their licenses will be revoked. Large farms with an annual income of 60 million won, or 55,000 US dollars, will be under review starting next year; smaller farms will be required to do the same by 2015.",
