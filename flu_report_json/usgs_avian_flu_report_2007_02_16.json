About half of the birds had died, probably from the cold, and the rest  have been destroyed.  The birds did not have veterinary health  certificates and are believed to have been thrown off a train by the  traffickers.  H5N1 has been reported at several locations in Russia this  year, and \"contact with wild birds\" have been listed in the official  report to the OIE.  However, these abandoned birds indicate that illegal  trade in pet and poultry might also be a possible route of introduction. (",

The institute had been conducting a survey of waterfowl droppings from  around the country.  The virus is not suspected to be connected with the  series of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in domestic poultry in Japan this year, and so  far no HPAI H5N1 isolations have been reported from wild birds during the  national survey.",

Examination of vendor stalls in the nearby Bird Garden by  the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) did not  detect any unusual mortality or illness in the birds for sale there. This is  the first time that the silver-eared mesia has been shown to be susceptible to  HPAI H5N1, but the species was part of a shipment of birds from Taiwan that was  in the quarantine facility outside London, UK, where H5N1 was detected in 2005.
