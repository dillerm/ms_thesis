		"subsection_content_4": "Two commercial ostrich farms, one in Western Cape Province and one in Eastern Cape Province are experiencing outbreaks of low pathogenic H7N1. Tests at the Agricultural Research Council\u2019s Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute on June 1 confirmed the presence of the virus. A total of 1,833 ostriches were housed on the two farms; 44 became ill and 1,493 (all of the ostriches on the Eastern Cape Province Farm) were slaughtered. The infection was discovered during routine surveillance. The source of the outbreak is unknown but control measures such as quarantine, movement control, screening, and disinfection of the premises have been undertaken.",
		"subsection_content_1": ". The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) reported on June 20 that a scaly-breasted munia (Lonchura punctulata) found dead in Yuen Long on June 18 has been confirmed to be positive for H5N1 bird flu. Cleansing and disinfection have been stepped up in the area and three chicken farms within 3 km of the find site were inspected. No signs of abnormal mortality or symptoms of bird flu were discovered on the farms, but they will be kept under enhanced surveillance as a precaution. The AFCD is encouraging all poultry farmers, bird shop owners, and license holders of pet poultry to strengthen precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza. The department will continue monitoring and surveillance of wild birds. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) remains vigilant in inspections of imported live poultry and live poultry stalls. The Department of Health continues to educate the public and remind them to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene to prevent bird flu.  The AFCD, FEHD, and the Customs and Excise Department are working together to deter the illegal import of poultry and birds into Hong Kong to ensure that all birds go through proper inspection and quarantine and to minimize the risk of bird flu.",
		"subsection_content_3": ". Mexican veterinary authorities are intensifying control measures for bird flu in a region that houses several large commercial farms after tests revealed that more than 200,000 birds in the area have died from highly pathogenic H7N3 bird flu. These are the first highly pathogenic bird flu outbreaks in Mexico since outbreaks of H5N2 in the mid 1990s. A report submitted to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) stated that intravenous pathogenicity tests revealed a highly pathogenic subtype of H7N3. The outbreaks began on June 13 at three commercial farms in Jalisco state, causing flu symptoms in the chickens. Of 1 million susceptible birds, 587,160 became ill and 211,424 died. About 60,000 have been culled so far to prevent the spread of the virus. Authorities are sampling birds at around 60 nearby farms, testing backyard poultry and poultry markets, instating quarantine measures in the region, limiting poultry movements near the outbreak, and conducting an epidemiologic investigation to determine the source of the virus. David A. Halvorson, DVM, an avian health expert at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul, said that U.S. poultry producers are always cautious about the potential for disease introduction from indirect contact with Mexican poultry. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), poultry imported from all countries except Canada must be quarantined for at least 30 days at a USDA Animal Import Center and be accompanied by import permits and veterinary health certificates. In 2004, highly pathogenic H7N3 outbreaks in British Columbia's Fraser Valley led to the culling of 19 million birds, and two related human infections were confirmed. The patients, both men who had been exposed to infected poultry on the farms, were the first known H7N3 infections in humans. Both had conjunctivitis with mild flulike symptoms.",
