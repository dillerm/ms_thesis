The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs announced on March 19 that low-pathogenic bird flu was detected in sixty chickens on an organic poultry farm in Zeewold, Flevoland Province. The disease was confirmed by testing at the Central Veterinary Institute in Leystad. Though the virus is a mild H7N7 variant with no effect on human health, all 23,500 hens on the farm have been culled in accordance with European rules. This action will prevent the virus from spreading and mutating into a more deadly variant. On March 19 officials placed a ban on the transport of poultry, eggs, and poultry manure in a 1 km radius around Zeewolde. There are no other poultry farms within this area. Last week, an outbreak of low-pathogenic bird flu H7N7 was reported in Lochem. It is unknown at this time whether or not the outbreaks are related.",
