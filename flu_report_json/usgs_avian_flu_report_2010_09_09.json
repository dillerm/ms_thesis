Further investigation by Participatory Disease Surveillance and Response (PDSR), Agriculture of Livestock Service West Aceh has confirmed that those chickens died from H5N1 bird flu. The dead chickens have been burned and buried and the remaining chickens have been culled to prevent the spread of the disease.",

Of the farm\u2019s 1,500 pigs, 150 showed symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, fever, and loss of appetite. Testing by the Finnish Food Safety Authority showed that H1N1 was the cause of illness. Officials are controlling the movement of swine within the country and screening animals to prevent the spread of the disease. It is not known how the pigs became infected with the disease.",

		"subsection_content_5": "Researchers have found that a strain of H5N1 bird flu that mutated in pigs in Indonesia has acquired the ability to infect humans. The discovery was made by a team led by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Tokyo's Institute of Medical Science. Kawaoka is concerned that a highly pathogenic virus that spreads easily to humans could develop without being noticed unless pigs are regularly tested for viruses even when they are asymptomatic. The Japanese researchers, in cooperation with Indonesia's Airlangga University, examined nasal, fecal and serum samples from 702 randomly chosen pigs in 14 provinces from 2005 to 2009. Among 39 H5N1 samples analyzed, one was found to have the ability to attach itself to human nasal or throat cells. The team\u2019s findings are reported in an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases (see citation for Nidom below).\r\n            (",

		"subsection_content_2": "Elsewhere, experts are warning that, without stringent surveillance, H5N1 bird flu could re-emerge in Thailand. They worry that migratory birds or pet dogs and cats might transmit the disease to humans. Pilaipan Puthavathana, a virologist at Siriraj Hospital's Department of Microbiology, Mahidol University, said \"Nobody dares to say the virus has been wiped out here as long as our neighboring countries continue to report bird flu cases.\" Thailand has not had a bird flu case in humans since July 2006. A total of 27 cases were confirmed with 17 deaths reported during a series of bird flu outbreaks from 2004 to 2006. She pointed out that seagulls migrating from provinces in China that have recently experienced bird flu outbreaks could bring the disease back to Thailand. The virologist said disease surveillance among pet dogs and cats was essential if bird flu virus re-emerged in the future. Studies have found H5N1 antigens in cats and dogs, showing that these animals could survive bird flu but transmit the virus to their owners.",
