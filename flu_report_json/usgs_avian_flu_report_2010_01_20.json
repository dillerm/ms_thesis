		"subsection_content_3": ". Two pigs on a farm in Sicily tested positive for pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus after showing symptoms of influenza beginning December 3. One of the two pigs that had originally fallen ill was slaughtered and the remaining pigs on the farm (12) were tested for infection. Nine pigs tested positive for antibodies to the virus and all of them tested negative for the virus. All of the pigs recovered fully within a few days. The origin of the outbreak is unknown.",

		"subsection_content_5": ". The Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal has confirmed H5N1 bird flu as the cause of death for two hens in Murshidabad district. The district administration began a culling operation on January 14 to prevent the spread of the disease. The culling will take place within a 3-kilometer radius of the villages where the hens died and farmers will be compensated for culled birds. There are also twenty teams working on disinfection in ten villages. As a further precaution, the movement of poultry products in the area has been restricted. Between January 5 and January 15, over 1,000 hens and ducks died mysteriously in various villages in Murshidabad. Officials initially thought that the birds had died of cold and Ranikhet disease, but as the number of dying birds increased, they became concerned and decided to test for bird flu.",

		"subsection_header_2": "Passive (mortality) surveillance systems have been advocated as an effective mechanism for HPAI H5N1 surveillance.  The best example is perhaps Hong Kong, which reported 26% of worldwide cases of HPAI H5N1 infection in wild birds in 2009. The island territory constitutes just over 1,000 square kilometers and exercises stringent biosecurity on its poultry operations, but its proximity to HPAI H5N1-endemic countries in the region, high urban to rural land use, dense population, motivated public, and sustained surveillance systems make the discovery of dead bird carcasses likely.",

		"subsection_content_9": ". The Centers for Disease Control reported on January 15 that a boy from Iowa had contracted an H3N2 strain of swine flu that is different from both the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus and seasonal H3N2 strains. An investigation showed no evidence of person-to-person transfer so the strain is not likely to spread. The boy caught the strain in September, but was not tested until November. He did not need to be hospitalized and recovered fully on his own. \u201cWhile these cases are rare, they're not unheard of,\" Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, said, \"We do detect them from time to time and it's important for us to investigate, which happened in this case. And luckily there wasn't any evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission.\" It is not known how the boy contracted the virus.\r\n            (",
		"subsection_content_4": "Recent research by scientists from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Indonesia has shown that outbreaks of H5N1 are closely related to the migration of wild birds. They presented their research at the fifth regional meeting of the Asian Partnership on Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (APEIR). According to Lei Fumin, researcher of Institute of Zoology with Chinese Academy of Sciences, the research team studied avian influenza outbreaks along the bird migration routes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Their study indicated that outbreaks often coincide with migration patterns in time and location. Lakes and wetlands were found to be of particular importance in the transmission of influenza viruses. The research showed that the role of wild birds in the transmission of bird flu requires attention. Dr. Witthawat Wiriyarat from Thailand, who joined the research team, proposed to form a regional surveillance network to monitor avian influenza viruses in migratory birds. The discovery of large quantities of migratory bird carcasses in some of the lakes around the plateau in 2005 caused scientists to investigate the role of migratory birds in the transmission of bird flu.",
		"subsection_content_6": ". The Livestock Service of South Lampung has announced a return of bird flu in the area. Three outbreaks of bird flu have occurred since the beginning of 2010, killing a total of 94 birds. According to the head of Animal Health and Veterinary Public Health of South Lampung, Agung Kusmartuti, the area is susceptible for bird flu transmission because it functions as a trading area with high activity and dense poultry movement. The Livestock Service has instituted control measures, including disinfection of chicken houses and raising public awareness. Seasonal effects may have caused the increase in bird flu prevalence, since this is the peak of the rainy season in Indonesia.",

		"subsection_content_2": "In contrast, no wild birds infected with HPAI H5N1 were reported in endemic countries such as Indonesia, Vietnam, or Egypt in 2009.  However, HPAI H5N1 infections in wild birds were reported in China, Mongolia, and Russia. The indication that wild birds continue to be exposed to HPAI H5N1 was reinforced at the 5th APEIR (Asian Partnership on Emerging Infectious Diseases Research) regional meeting, where more than 30 institutional partners met at Kunming, China in January 2010. One APEIR study focuses is on the surveillance and monitoring of avian influenza viruses in migratory birds.  \u201cThis study concluded that wild birds are likely transmission vectors of avian influenza (AI), H5N1. There are differences between countries and between bird species. Wetlands and lakes along the flight paths of migratory birds are zones where highly pathogenic avian viruses remain viable and can be spread through wild bird migration. The study shows that some migratory birds\u2019 flight paths are closely related with outbreaks of H5N1 in poultry in space and time. The work has led to new H5N1 detection mechanisms and raised research priority on the role of wild birds in transmission of AI\u201d (APEIR statement 1/15/10).",

She came down with symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and difficulty breathing on January 6 and was hospitalized on January 11. She was treated with Tamiflu and is in stable condition. This is the 91st case of bird flu in Egypt since the first outbreak of the disease.",
		"subsection_content_1": "In 2009, reports of HPAI H5N1 were dwarfed by the emergence of the pandemic H1N1 (swine flu) virus in April and by cutbacks in national surveillance programs. However, HPAI H5N1 outbreaks were reported in 17 countries, many of which had been affected in the past. During 2009, Egypt reported 39 human HPAI H5N1 cases, including 4 deaths, and Indonesia reported 20 human cases, 19 of which were fatal. Vietnam reported 140 poultry HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in 18 provinces and cities. Only two of Indonesia\u2019s 33 provinces were considered HPAI H5N1-free in 2009 and during the first six months of 2009, 100 villages in 20 governorates had HPAI H5N1 outbreaks; in the month of October alone, 134 villages were positive for HPAI H5N1.",

		"subsection_content_8": ". A 17-year-old boy suspected of having contracted the H5N1 bird flu virus is in critical condition at the Arifin Achmad regional public hospital in Pekanbaru, Riau. According to the head of bird flu control, Azisman Saad, the patient is receiving intensive care in an isolated room but is still in a coma-like condition with a high fever. A sample has been sent for testing to confirm H5N1. It is not known how the patient was infected, but he began to show symptoms on January 15. The hospital recently cured a 4-year-old girl who had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. She has fully recovered and has been moved from isolation to an ordinary ward for observation."
