Dukakak, the local name for egrets, fly from China to the Philippines each year and can eat up to six bangus, or milkfish, a day.  Fishermen use firecrackers and nylon wires to protect their fish from the birds that number in the thousands. The provincial veterinarian, Benedicto Perez, also worries about the birds bringing bird flu to the area. However, the Department of Agriculture has been testing birds in 34 provinces since January and all samples have so far been negative and the Philippines is one of only two countries in the area to remain unaffected by H5N1.",
		"subsection_content_3": "Bird flu has been detected at a village in the northern province of Xayaboury. The Xayaboury provincial Avian Influenza Control Committee declared October 3rd that all poultry within 1 km of the village will be culled, while villagers who have poultry located within 5 km were told to kill their birds at the first sign of illness without waiting for positive test results for avian influenza.",
