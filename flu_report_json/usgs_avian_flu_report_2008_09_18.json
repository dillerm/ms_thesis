The body of Sir Mark Sykes, a British aristocrat and diplomat, was exhumed on the 15th as part of medical research to test genetic material from the 1918 virus.  Sykes body was buried in a lead-lined coffin which may have preserved the tissues needed for testing. This is the first time the ecclesiastical court has approved an exhumation for medical research.(",

Trace-back analysis has identified a farm in Nalae village, Oudomxay province, as the origin of the outbreak. Though no birds tested positive in the suspected farm, another local flock that originated from the suspect farm experienced a 2% mortality and has tested positive for H5N1.  A 5 km surveillance zone has been imposed around the farm in Oudomxay.",
