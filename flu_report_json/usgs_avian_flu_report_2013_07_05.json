A rapid response team of the District Veterinary Office (DVO), Kathmandu culled all the remaining chickens at a poultry farm in Kathmandu on July 1 after it was confirmed that they were infected with H5N1 bird flu virus. The farm housed 2,000 chickens, out of which, about 600 died from the disease and 1,400 were culled. The owner took some dead chickens to the DVO after they started dying. The Central Animal Health Laboratory confirmed the virus on July 1. \"After the laboratory gave positive report, we immediately deployed rapid response team to destroy the chickens in the tainted farm,\" said Bhola Raj Acharya, chief of Kathmandu DVO. The team will also dispose of chicken feed, eggs and droppings, and disinfect the farm. Officials encourage all poultry farmers and members of the public to take proper care of chickens, inform veterinary officials if chickens are displaying suspicious behavior, cook chicken properly before eating, and wash their hands properly with soap after touching chicken.",
		"subsection_content_4": ". A joint statement by the World Health Organization and the Cambodian Health Ministry on July 2 reported that a six-year-old girl from Southwestern Kampot province had died from H5N1 bird flu. Tests by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge confirmed on June 28 that the patient was positive for H5N1 bird flu. She had developed a fever and headache on June 24 and her condition worsened with cough and dyspnea. The girl was first taken to a private clinic and was moved to Kantha Bopha Hospital on June 28. At the hospital she was treated with Tamiflu, but she died later that night. There have been recent poultry deaths in her village and it is likely that she was exposed to sick and dead poultry. \"Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians. This is the 13th case of H5N1 infection in humans this year,\" Health Minister Mam Bunheng said in the statement. He added, \"I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks. Parents and guardians must also make sure children wash their hands with soap and water after any contact with poultry.\" Of the 13 cases in Cambodia this year, only four people have survived.",

		"subsection_content_5": ". The Public Health Agency of Canada reported that an American man at an Edmonton hospital tested positive for H7 bird flu virus. According to Canada's acting chief public health officer, the man is not currently ill from the flu and is not contagious. Dr. Gregory Taylor says that the event is a reminder that viruses like the new H7N9 bird flu are only a plane ride away. The blood test that was used to diagnose the previous infection could not determine the neuraminadase (N) component of the virus, but the specialist who treated him in Edmonton was on the lookout for H7N9 bird flu. In China, 132 people have been infected by H7N9 bird flu this spring and at least 39 have died from the disease. The patient had travelled to China in late May, though not a part of the country that has any recorded infections with H7N9 flu. He had also travelled to Singapore and India in recent weeks. The patient first became ill in India and spent time in an intensive care unit there, though it is not known what illness led to this hospitalization. After being released from the hospital in India, he travelled to the United Arab Emirates and boarded a flight to San Francisco. He became ill on the plane and lost consciousness, perhaps from a diabetic coma. The flight was diverted to Edmonton where quarantine officers determined that his symptoms did not indicate active influenza. Once he was in the hospital in Edmonton, he developed pneumonia and doctors ordered a battery of tests. These tests were negative for active viral infection, but turned up evidence of a past infection with H7 flu. The Canadian Public Health Agency has sent samples from the man to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which has not been able to confirm the presence of the antibody to H7 influenza. The case is now listed as a \u201csuspect positive\u201d according to the Canadian Public Health Agency as both organizations investigate this case further.",

One outbreak of bird flu began on May 28 in Giriraj birds raised in a household in Naranyi Province and two outbreaks have begun in Lumbini Province, one on June 2 in backyard ducks and one in broiler chickens on June 7. A total of 1,675 susceptible birds were housed in the various locations, 410 birds came down with H5N1 birds and died, and 1,165 birds were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. The cause of the outbreaks is unknown, but the premises have been disinfected and surveillance activities are ongoing throughout the country. All of the outbreaks were resolved as of June 14.",
