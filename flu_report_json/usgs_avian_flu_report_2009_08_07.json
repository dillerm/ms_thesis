	"content_1": "Nepal. Nepal’s national news agency reported that bird flu was suspected at a farm where 40 chickens died suddenly on July 31. The farm is in Sunsari district about 220 km southeast of Kathmandu. Technicians from the District Livestock Services Office, who are investigating the cause of death, went to the farm to collect information after the chickens died. Several nearby areas have been defined as high-risk for bird flu. USA. On August 5 the Minnesota Board of Animal Health quarantined a commercial turkey flock in Meeker County after avian influenza H7N9 virus was discovered during routine testing. Dale Lauer, the assistant director and a veterinarian, stressed that the flu strain was different from the more lethal H5N1 strain circulating mostly in Asia. The quarantined flock is not showing signs of illness, but officials are concerned that without precautions the virus could evolve into a strain that would be lethal to the state’s many poultry flocks. The infected flock and those within a 3-mile radius have been placed under quarantine for six weeks and will be tested repeatedly for the virus. The Minnesota Health Department is monitoring 20 poultry workers from the farm, but so far none of them have shown any symptoms."
