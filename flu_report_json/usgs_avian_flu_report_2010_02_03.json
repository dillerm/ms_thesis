	"content_3": ". 100 birds on a farm of 43,000 died from H5N1 bird flu on January 24. Samples from the farm tested positive for H5N1 at the Northern Poultry Disease Laboratory and Kimron Veterinary Institute on January 26. The farm is divided into three poultry houses that are under extremely high biosecurity and clinical signs only appeared in one house. The source of the outbreak is suspected to be contact with infected droppings from wild birds. According to ProMED “Being a biosecurity plant, its staff is required to shower and change clothing when entering the premises. However, after entering, they may walk between the 3 houses in an (enclosed) yard, which is not covered. If infected wild birds, flying above the yard, excrete their droppings there, theoretically the mentioned scenario could be possible.” The article noted that local or migratory birds are known to be infected with H5N1 at the present time. Seven hundred birds have been culled and other preventative measures such as quarantine, movement control, and zoning have been taken. Officials are also planning to stamp out the disease, screen other birds, and disinfect the premises.",
