The HPAI H5N8 virus has never been found before in Germany,  but had previously been found in South Korea where it infected at least 28 farms and lead to the culling of 14 million birds in early 2014.",

		"subsection_content_1": "The Environment Ministry confirmed the discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N8) today from two wild bird environmental samples collected on November 3rd in Yasugi, Shimane Prefecture in western Japan.  The H5N8 strain was detected on November 3rd in two samples of droppings from migratory tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus).  This is the same strain of avian influenza that was detected in South Korea in January and Kumamoto Prefecture Japan in April of this year.  In 2010, the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza was first detected in wild bird fecal samples before outbreaks in farms and wild birds throughout Japan.  HPAI H5N8 was reported last week in a farm in Germany and analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase RNA segments show that the German virus is closely related to the virus in South Korea. Whether the Japan H5N8 is related to the same group is not known at this time. The source of the introduction of the HPAI H5N8 virus into Germany is unknown at this time, but the finding of HPAI H5N8 in wild bird fecal samples in Japan might support one mechanism of introduction. The Prefecture is warning all local poultry farms to take preventative measures against infection.",

The ban on selling live poultry in the cities of Guangzhou, Foshan and Shenzhen will be expanded to the entire province of Guangdong. Imports from mainland China to Hong Kong are being strictly monitored to prevent further spread of the virus.",
