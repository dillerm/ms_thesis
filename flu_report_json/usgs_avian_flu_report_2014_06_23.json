	"content_1": "A team of researchers led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison has found that some genes from influenza viruses recently isolated from wild birds are very similar to those in the devastating 1918 pandemic flu virus, differing by only a few amino acids. The team’s study, recently published in Cell Host and Microbe, explores the risk of avian influenza virus emergence and adaptation to humans, and the potential for a resultant pandemic. According to senior study author Kawaoka, the report’s findings indicate the need for continued surveillance of influenza viruses in wild birds, as well as improved influenza vaccines and antivirals in preparation for a pandemic scenario.",

	"content_2": "According to Daegu Metropolitan Government (DMG), the H5N8 virus was found in three chickens that recently died at a poultry farm in Okcheon.  Since late last month, 100 chickens and 94 geese have died on the farm.  All the surviving birds ? 13 geese and 388 chickens ? at the farm were culled. The farm apparently bought 107 baby geese from a farm in Hongseong on June 14. Authorities in Daegu are stepping up efforts to contain the disease by setting up checkpoints to disinfect vehicles and prohibiting poultry from being transported within three kilometers from where the outbreak was reported.",
