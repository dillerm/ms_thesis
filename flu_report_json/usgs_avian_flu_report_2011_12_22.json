The Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University\u2019s Mailman School of Public Health and the EcoHealth Alliance reported that five of the seal deaths investigated were caused by a bacterial pneumonia brought about by the Influenza A virus, subtype H3N8.  These findings were confirmed by the Connecticut Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory and the virus was isolated at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center.  Dr. Hon Ip of the USGS National Wildlife Health Center said on December 20, \u201cThis is the first time that a virus similar to the H3N8 avian influenza virus has been associated with a large-scale mortality in marine mammals.\u201d  Additional tests on other animals are currently being conducted to find out more information about this virus as well as investigations whether this virus or some other microorganism is involved in the deaths of other seals.  H3N8 avian influenza appears to have a low risk of transmission to humans, but a spokesperson for the New England Aquarium has directed people to maintain a safe distance from any seal, alive or dead, this winter.  If you see a stranded seal, stay at least 150 feet away, keep dogs leashed and away from animals or carcasses, and call the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Fisheries Service\u2019s stranding hot line at (866) 755-6622.",
