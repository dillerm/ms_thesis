  "content_1": "The Thailand Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation is continuing its nationwide campaign to randomly test birds around the country for the deadly avian influenza virus, H5N1, in hopes to prevent further outbreaks. The team recently collected samples from over 300 barn swallows in Phuket province and will be collecting samples in Samut Prakan province, Trang provice, and Krabi province in the upcoming months. In addition to looking at the birdsâ€™ overall health, they are also testing their saliva and droppings. Since 2004, Thailand has reported 25 cases of human infection, 17 resulting in deaths; however, the country has not had any human deaths in the past six years and officials hope that the randomized tests will help combat further spread.",

  "content_3": "The National Steering Committee for Bird Flu Control reported outbreaks of H5N1 at a meeting earlier this week. Two poultry farms in Ben Cau District and Tay Ninh Town were found to be the sources of the outbreak resulting in the death and culling of about 3,500 birds. The farms are located across the border from Cambodia where several human H5N1 cases were reported last month. The Vietnamese public security force, along with veterinary service personnel, are closely monitoring poultry coming in and out of the country due to the recent human deaths in neighboring Cambodia and the upcoming lunar New Year where large amounts of chicken meat will be consumed."
