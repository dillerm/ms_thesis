These birds, 1 peregrine falcon (Falco peregrines), 1 pochard (Aythya ferina), and 1 tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), were all found dead between March 10 and March 17 and have tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The source of the outbreak is unknown, but wild birds are being screened for the disease.",
		"subsection_content_4": ". On March 14, prefectural government authorities said that H5N1 bird flu infection was confirmed among chickens at a poultry farm in Chiba city, marking the first such case in the region.  A total of four birds were found dead at the Chiba farm on March 11 and 12, and a genetic test confirmed that four of seven birds checked were infected by the highly pathogenic strain of the virus.  On March 13, local authorities culled about 35,000 birds at the farm and restricted the movements of another 869,000 birds being raised within a 10-kilometer radius of the affected farm.  ''This is a very severe situation as damage from the huge earthquake is also serious,'' said Chiba Governor Kensaku Morita at a press conference, referring to the earthquake that recently struck northeastern and eastern Japan.",

The girl had a history of cough and fever (and subsequently recovered) and was admitted to the same influenza sentinel surveillance center on March 8. IEDCR Director Mahmudur Rahman said that this most recent case is not related to the earlier one.  \"We are lucky that the strain (clade 2.2) of H5N1, which circulates in Bangladesh, is less virulent, so it causes less infection to humans,\" Rahman said, adding, \"but we have to be careful as it has the potential to change into another class (2.1), which was highly infectious to humans.\u201d The IEDCR is working on ascertaining the source of infection of the second baby.  The institution has urged the public not to panic, but to be aware of the disease and to take protective measures to prevent future outbreaks.",

Rahman added that family members of the child were also examined, and that IEDCR was also examining the areas where the child visited with her parents this year.

		"subsection_content_3": ". Researchers at the National Sun Yat-sen University urged farmers in central and southern Taiwan to reinforce the nets around their chicken ranches to prevent the invasion of cattle egrets, which they suggest could be major carriers and spreaders of the H5N1 bird flu virus.  According to Chang Hsueh-wen, a Biology professor at the University, long-term observations and studies by his team found that cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis) were frequently lured to chicken ranches to catch insects that were attracted by chicken droppings.  Chang added that the cattle egrets tend to mix with other migratory birds at wetlands or water reservoirs in southern parts of the island, and that this allows the egrets to easily spread H5N1 bird flu viruses that can also infect human beings.",
