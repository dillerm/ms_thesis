		"subsection_content_4": ".  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued an advance contract notice for companies interested in participating in a study to detect levels and patterns of bird flu in Canada.  About 600 dabbling ducks and 2,000 various aquatic birds will be tested from different Canadian provinces at a lab in Winnipeg with results stored in a national database.  Soren Alexandersen, executive director of the CFIA\u2019s National Center for Foreign Animal Disease, stated that it is important to track avian influenza strains and use this background information in the event of a possible poultry infection or a public health risk.  The survey, funded by both Canadian and U.S. governments, offers an initial $250,000 contract with another $500,000 for two more years if the study is extended.",
