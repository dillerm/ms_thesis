	"content_2": "Germany. In the state of Bavaria, routine testing has confirmed that highly pathogenic H5N1 killed 4,000 ducks from a flock of 165,000 at a farm in Erlangen, according to a report from the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Contaminated straw is suspected as the source of H5N1, but the chief veterinarian in the district said it was unclear how the straw, which was stored on the farm, became contaminated, although he suspects wild birds. The extent and duration of the H5N1 outbreak may have been more extensive than initially suspected, as testing of birds culled from two of the other 15 poultry sheds on the farm have tested positive for H5N1. Similar to an outbreak at a commercial turkey farm in Suffolk, UK, the birds in these two other sheds did not have any clinical signs. Subsequent sequencing of the virus shows that it's related to H5N1 detected in wild birds in Germany and poultry in the Czech Republic earlier this summer. Vietnam. Thirty-five chickens and 150 ducks from a household 80 km north of Hanoi died; the birds tested positive for H5N1. Around 700 other ducks and chickens have been culled to contain the outbreak."
