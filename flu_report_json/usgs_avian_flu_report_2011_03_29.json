The American Veterinary Medical Association published the following news update on March 24: “A letter published in the April 2011 edition of the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal described respiratory disease due to confirmed 2009 H1N1 influenza infection in a 7-year old black-footed ferret, a 12-year old badger and a 19-year old binturong (also called a bearcat) housed in the San Diego zoological garden. According to the letter, these animals developed the infection during the initial pandemic in 2009 and they were likely infected through exposure to an infected human caretaker. The severity of disease in the badger and binturong necessitated euthanasia, but the black-footed ferret recovered with supportive care.”  Read the letter in EID here: http://www.cdc.gov/eid/content/17/4/747.htm",
