	"content_1": "The National Veterinary Institute of Denmark reported that they have found the low pathogenic H10N7 influenza virus from two seals from Anholt fjord in early July and again in September.  Avian influenza was also found at Hvide Sande, Sædding, and Skalliingen on the west coast in October; the virus there has not been subtyped but is likely to be the same strain.  The same virus may also have been detected in Sweden and Germany where large die offs of seals has also occurred. The seals probably contracted the virus through contact with wild birds or their droppings.  There has been no evidence of the virus spreading from seal to seal, and no human infections identified in these outbreaks.  This marks the first major outbreak of seal mortality that is due to influenza virus in Europe, whereas in North America, repeated outbreaks of influenza-caused mass mortality have occurred, and the most recent outbreak in 2011 was caused by an avian influenza H3N8 virus.
