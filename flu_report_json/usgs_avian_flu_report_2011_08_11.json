	"content_1": ".  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued an advance contract notice for companies interested in participating in a study to detect levels and patterns of bird flu in Canada.  About 600 dabbling ducks and 2,000 various aquatic birds will be tested from different Canadian provinces at a lab in Winnipeg with results stored in a national database.  Soren Alexandersen, executive director of the CFIA’s National Center for Foreign Animal Disease, stated that it is important to track avian influenza strains and use this background information in the event of a possible poultry infection or a public health risk.  The survey, funded by both Canadian and U.S. governments, offers an initial $250,000 contract with another $500,000 for two more years if the study is extended.",

	"content_2": ".  Throughout June into early July, nine ostrich farms in the Western Cape Province of South Africa encountered outbreaks of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza. The virus was detected through routine surveillance but tested negative on PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Additional PCR tests were conducted and infection was then confirmed.  So far, 14 ostriches have been destroyed and an additional 1,186 have been slaughtered out of a total of 1,706 cases.  The source of the outbreaks remains unknown, but implemented control measures include stamping out, quarantine, and screening.",

	"content_3": ".  Due to high temperatures in July, a turkey flock in Minnesota suffered a heat-related death loss of 2,500 turkeys.  Originally thought to be associated with low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 subtype, samples were sent to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Their findings listed the birds’ deaths due to heat stress and not avian influenza.  The flock of turkeys has been retested several times throughout the month of July with all test results negative for avian influenza. The flock was depopulated on August 1, and cleaning and disinfection were scheduled for August 4.",

	"content_4": ".  In the Demnhoor district of Egypt, a 6-year-old girl developed symptoms of bird flu and was hospitalized on July 12.  She was diagnosed with H5N1 highly pathogenic influenza, treated with oseltamivir, an antiviral medication, recovered and was discharged from the hospital on July 30.  Investigations indicate that the 6-year-old had exposure to poultry suspected to be infected with bird flu.  Out of 151 cases of human infection of bird flu in Egypt, 52 have been fatal."
