The patient was treated in the internal medicine isolation unit of M Djamil hospital for four hours before her death. She had originally been admitted to Talu public health center, was transferred to Jambak Pasbar regional hospital, and then transferred again to M Djamil hospital because her condition was deteriorating.

M Djamil hospital collected the patient\u2019s blood and throat swab samples for further examination at the Indonesia Ministry of Health Research and Development laboratory.

Taubenberger from the National Institutes of Health suggests that the outbreak, which was followed by a national outbreak of influenza in horses, may have been highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI). The epizootic was called \u201chenfluenza\u201d at the time, but was not discussed in the scientific literature and had to be researched through web-based searching of newspaper archives. During the outbreak, whole flocks usually got sick at the same time, with most or all of the birds dying. The disease struck prairie chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese as well as chickens. The first documented outbreak of HPAI occurred only 6 years later in 1878.",
