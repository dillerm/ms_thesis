WHO spokesman Ibrahim al-Kerdani said the governments of the participating nations must still ratify the decision, though WHO regional director Hussein Gezairi said they were likely to agree to the restrictions.

		"subsection_content_3": "U.K. Two Anglican dioceses in the UK are changing the way that they handle communion in an effort to reduce the spread of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 flu. Instead of worshippers drinking wine from a common cup that is wiped with a cloth after each person sips, they will only eat wafers that are consecrated during the service. The change is a temporary measure to prevent the spread of disease. \"Particularly where vulnerable groups are involved, we think it's important that reasonable steps are taken to minimize the risk of church worship activity facilitating the spread of the disease,\" church spokesman Ben Wilson said. Britain has been the European nation hit hardest by the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus with thousands of cases estimated and thirty deaths reported. Churches in New Zealand, Argentina, Chile, and the United States have made similar changes to communion services.",
