Ron Fouchier of the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands recently reported that as few as five mutations in two genes allows the H5N1 virus to become airborne and spread between ferrets without reducing the lethal effects of the virus. H5N1 bird flu evolved in poultry and spread across Eurasia in 2005-2006, but even now, no strain of the H5N1 virus spreads readily among mammals (including humans).  Fouchier states that since the mutations used in the experiments have all occurred separately in birds, the mutations could occur together. University of Hong Kong flu virologist, Malik Peiris, believes this means a strain of H5N1, that is transmissible between humans, could develop in birds. Peter Palese, a flu specialist at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, disagrees saying ferrets are not humans and the H5N1 bird flu has failed to mutate into a form that can jump between people.  However, Jeffery Tubenberger of the U.S. National Institutes of Health in Maryland, who studies how bird flu became the pandemic of 1918, claims that just because the H5N1 virus has not adapted to spreading easily among mammals does not mean the virus cannot adapt in the future and spread through humans.",

After poultry farmers observed dozens of dead chickens in the South Sulawesi Province of Indonesia, tests conducted by the Veterinary Disease Investigation Center showed the chickens were infected with H5N1 bird flu.  To prevent the spread of disease, farmers burned the dead chickens and disinfected the surviving chickens, while officials are isolating the affected area.",
