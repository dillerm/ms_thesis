		"subsection_content_5": ". Rapid response teams from the District Animal Health Office of Kathmandu destroyed over 19,000 eggs on December 25 after bird flu was confirmed in a Kathmandu-based poultry farm. The central veterinary laboratory under the Directorate of Animal Health (DoAH) confirmed bird-flu virus at the private farm owned by Basnet on December 23. The owner reported the outbreak when birds began dying. He claimed that all of his 2,500 chickens had already died and were buried by the time the rapid response team arrived. However, the rapid response team dug where he claimed to have buried the chickens and found nothing. Basnet is in police custody and the location of the poultry is being investigated. They suspect that he may have quickly sold the chickens at market. A meeting of the district co-ordination committee determined that the eggs should be destroyed and the farm disinfected. Bird flu was confirmed on another private farm owned by Pokharel within 50 meters of Basnet\u2019s farm on December 26. According to Narayan Prasad Ghimire, senior veterinarian at DoAH, around 3,000 chickens were found to have been infected by the virus. Department of Animal Health officials on Wednesday culled over 2240 chickens and destroyed 700 kilograms of chicken grain and 105 eggs on the farm. Both sites and surrounding poultry farms have been placed under surveillance.
