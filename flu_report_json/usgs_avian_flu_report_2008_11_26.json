An initial hospital test of the patient's blood samples was positive for H5N1 and the samples were also tested positive by the Hasanuddin University School of Medicine. The hospital did not officially use these test results, but deferred to test results from the Health Ministry. All of those tests were negative, the Ministry of Health said on November 20th, and this week all 17 people have been officially cleared.  However early in the week, chickens were found dead in the neighborhood where the people lived and have been confirmed as being positive for bird flu.",

		"subsection_content_3": "Xinhua newspaper reports that Jakarta officials plan to push market live-poultry sellers out of the city in an effort to prevent avian influenza outbreaks. \"As we are closing down their businesses, they will have to find alternative ventures,\" said Edy Setiarto, head of Jakarta's Husbandry, Fisheries and Maritimes Agency. Vendors would have to shut down their operations completely and not be allowed to sell live chickens in or to traditional markets by April, 2010. It is unknown if the vendors will be compensated for business losses. Only two poultry plants, both run by a private agency, will be permitted to distribute chicken meat to traditional markets. \"The move was part of measures to implement a 2007 poultry-restriction bylaw aimed at controlling the sale of poultry in Jakarta,\" said Setiarto. The bylaw attempted to halt future outbreaks of bird flu in Indonesia which has the largest number of human cases in the world.",

While H5N1 mainly attacks poultry, a global study commissioned by the FAO has found incidence of bird flu in migratory birds in various parts of the world. Using bird banding, researchers will try to discover the basic study of the behavior of migratory birds that may or may not be carrying avian influenza.",
