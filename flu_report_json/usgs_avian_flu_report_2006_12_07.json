The observation stand was planned to be located at the   Kangso Ecological Garden in Pamson, near the Han River. About 5,000 birds of 20   species, including some that originate from Siberia and Mongolia, visit the   region each year. In   Heilongjiang Province, China, officials at local monitoring stations have been   told to keep a close watch over migratory birds at wild bird habitats and live   bird markets for signs of animal epidemics as the province borders South Korea,   where recent H5N1 outbreaks have occurred. Vietnam plans to vaccinate its endangered   white-winged ducks (Cairina scutulata) with a H5N9 vaccine from Italy. It   is estimated that the total population of wild white-winged ducks in the world   is less than 2,500 adults.",
