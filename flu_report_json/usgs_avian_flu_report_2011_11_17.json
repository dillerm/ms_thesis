	"content_1": ".  From September 1 through November 3, 146 dead seals were washed-up on the shores of Maine, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts, most of which were less than a year old.  This number is three times higher than normal for seal mortality.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed that preliminary tests on 5 dead seals yielded positive results for the influenza A virus.  Due to these results, a formal Unusual Mortality Event has been declared and an expanded investigation into the seal deaths will be conducted to identify and characterize the specific type of influenza A virus found in the seals.  While the NOAA determines whether the dead seals are a potential human health risk, people and their pets have been warned to stay away from stranded seals and are requested to report any future sightings of dead seals.In relation to the seal deaths, a large amount of birds, mainly seagulls, have been found dead on beaches in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts over a similar time period.  Testing the dead birds for toxins, such as algae blooms, and well as other causes is being conducted by the NOAA in conjunction with Woods Hole Oceanographic Institutions and the New Hampshire Veterinarian Diagnostic Lab.  Tissue samples will also be examined for signs of infectious and non-infectious diseases and trauma.",
