This number is three times higher than normal for seal mortality.  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) confirmed that preliminary tests on 5 dead seals yielded positive results for the influenza A virus.  Due to these results, a formal Unusual Mortality Event has been declared and an expanded investigation into the seal deaths will be conducted to identify and characterize the specific type of influenza A virus found in the seals.  While the NOAA determines whether the dead seals are a potential human health risk, people and their pets have been warned to stay away from stranded seals and are requested to report any future sightings of dead seals.",
