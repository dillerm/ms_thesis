A 63-year-old man showing symptoms is also suspected to have contracted the disease.  In Egypt there have been 14 deaths so far this year and 33 since the start of the winter season.  The virus is facilitated by many unlicensed poultry farms and those who breed birds in their houses.",

The subtype has not been identified.  The flock will be culled and the disposal site will be monitored to prevent further spread of the disease.  Because it a lowly pathogenic strain, no quarantine will be issued.",
		"subsection_content_4": "A case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in two dead wild house crows (Corvus splendens) in the Haliapur area of Sultanpur district.  To prevent further spread of the virus, poultry farms within a 1 km radius are being scanned, and those within 20 km are under surveillance.  This follows an outbreak in Amethi on March 13, in which 350 ducks, hens, and pigeons died and 850 were culled.",

The patients are a 34-year-old man and a 17-year-old from Kunming, Yunnan Province.  Both have been hospitalized and are in stable condition.  The most recent data from The World Health Organization, dated March 3, puts the total number of human cases of H5N1 at 784 with 429 deaths since 2003.",

		"subsection_content_2": "Several strains of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus have been reported in domestic poultry, captive and free-living wild birds.  The first detection was in December 2014, and reports have continued to the present.  No human infections have yet been detected, although similar viruses have infected people in other countries, causing illness and in some cases death.  Most human infections have been caused from contact with infected birds or their secretions.  In the guidance that was updated this week, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) recommends that people avoid contact with wild birds, dead or ill poultry, and surfaces that have been contaminated with feces.  People who have come into contact with infected birds should monitor themselves for symptoms, and health care providers should notify health departments of potential infections.",

Facilities within a 10 km radius are under inspection, and heightened supervision at crossing points between the Palestinian Authority and Israel is underway.  Avian influenza was also been identified in January and February at a farm in Moshav Avial in Israel and nearby Palestinian Territories.",

		"subsection_content_8": "Officials at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said they have ruled out wild birds as a source of the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus that affected a turkey flock Pope County earlier this month.  Migratory wildfowl were not in the area during the outbreak, and 148 fecal samples collected from resident wild birds were negative for the virus, eliminating wild birds as a potential cause.  Other experts disagree, arguing that the strain found in Pope County has the same makeup as strains found in other parts of the U.S. that came from wild birds and that the virus cant be migrating among turkey populations, as it is highly lethal and would kill the birds."
