India (HPAI H5N1)
A case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been confirmed in two dead wild house crows (Corvus splendens) in the Haliapur area of Sultanpur district.  To prevent further spread of the virus, poultry farms within a 1 km radius are being scanned, and those within 20 km are under surveillance.  This follows an outbreak in Amethi on March 13, in which 350 ducks, hens, and pigeons died and 850 were culled.
