China (HPAI H5N6)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports an additional case of highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus in a peacock farm in the Hunan province. This diagnosis was confirmed after tests at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute came back positive. A total of 381 birds died from the disease, and the remaining 5433 were culled to prevent further spread of the disease. In addition to culling, the following measures were taken: movement control; screening; disinfection; stamping out; and zoning. The source of the outbreak is unknown.
