Presence of infection and viral type were confirmed by the Servicio Nacional de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalmentaria (SENASICA), by intravenous pathogenicity index and virus isolation. Infected farms were first reported during early March. To date, 14,361 chickens and 25 Indian peafowl have died from infection and 145,201 birds have been destroyed. Affected farms have been depopulated and disinfected, and biosecurity measures limiting poultry movements have been instituted. Epidemiologic investigation of this outbreak is on-going. The source of this outbreak is currently unknown.
