H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 65-year-old woman is being treated at Sanglah hospital for suspected H5N1 bird flu. The woman had been experiencing fever and shortness of breath since January 2 when some of her chickens died suddenly and was rushed to the hospital on January 6 when she felt like she could not breathe. Klungkung Veterinary office confirmed that her chickens had died of H5N1. Dr. Ken Wirasandi, Sanglah hospital's Secretary of Avian Flu Prevention Program, said that her condition was stabilizing. A 2-year-old boy who was being treated for suspected bird flu died in isolation in Pekanbaru, Riau. A member of the hospital staff said that the boy had been fairly stable, but his condition deteriorated rapidly on the day that he died. The hospital is awaiting test results from the Health Ministry’s laboratory in Jakarta to confirm the cause of death.Indonesia’s Ministry of Health reported in late December that the country had experienced 20 cases of H5N1 in 2009 and 19 of them were fatal (case fatality rate of 95%). The report did not give many details but said that the last reported case had been in South Jakarta on September 23. Since 2005 there have been 161 human cases of H5N1 in Indonesia and 134 deaths.
