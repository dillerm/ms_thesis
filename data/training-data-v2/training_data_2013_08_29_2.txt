H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
 Earlier this week, officials confirmed four outbreaks of H5N1 in Pagretar VDC of Sindhupalchowk district.  To prevent the disease from spreading further, 1,300 chickens were destroyed, and officials are urging farmers throughout the country to notify their veterinarians if they notice any sick or dead birds, as the flu virus has been detected at more than half a dozen poultry farms throughout the area.
