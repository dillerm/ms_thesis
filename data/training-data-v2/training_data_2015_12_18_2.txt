France (HPAI H5N1, H5N2, H5N9)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has reported additional cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses in France. The National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease confirmed the presence of H5N2 on a duck farm in the Landes department; 25 H5N9 related deaths among ducks on a farm in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques department (the remaining 475 birds were culled to prevent further spread of the disease); and the presence of H5N1 among ducks on a farm in the Dordogne department. In order to control spread of these diseases, the following measures were utilized by all three departments: movement control; screening; disinfection; traceability; surveillance; stamping out; disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste; zoning; and prohibition of vaccination. The Dordogne department also plans to control wildlife reservoirs, and all have implemented protection and surveillance zones. The sources of these outbreaks are unknown. On top of the above cases confirmed by the OIE, the Ministry of Agriculture has report that the number of cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus in France have doubled in the last two days to thirty. The new cases have occurred in the same four departments previously affected, all in the southwest region of France. In Landes, nine outbreaks were reported, three among poultry tested prior to slaughter; in Dordogne three outbreaks were reported, one among poultry headed to slaughter; in Pyrénées Atlantiques one outbreak was reported among breeding ducks; and in Gers two outbreaks were reported among ducks and guinea fowls on poultry farms. The strains of these outbreaks are unknown, as are the number of fatalities and the causes of the outbreaks. Due to the relative closeness of these outbreaks to Spain, Spanish producers and authorities are on high alert for any potential spread of the virus.
