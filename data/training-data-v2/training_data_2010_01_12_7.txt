H5N1 in Humans in Hong Kong
A 3-year-old girl was recently diagnosed with H9N2 bird flu, a mild form of influenza that rarely occurs in humans. The Center for Health Protection said that the girl has been ill with a cough, fever, and runny nose since late November. She was admitted to a local hospital and a respiratory sample confirmed H9N2. The girl was discharged on December 11 and has recovered. An investigation into the cause of the disease is underway.
