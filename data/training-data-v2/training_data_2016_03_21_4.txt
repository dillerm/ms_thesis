Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports new cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in the states of Kaduna, Kano, and Plateau.  This analysis was confirmed after testing by the National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom.  A total of 893 birds died of the virus, and the remaining 12,812 were culled to prevent it spreading further.  Additional control measures to be implemented are: movement control; disinfection; quarantine; surveillance; stamping out; and official destruction of animal products.  The source of this outbreak is unknown, but poor farm biosecurity was noted.
