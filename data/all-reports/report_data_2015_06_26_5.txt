Avian Influenza in Humans in Egypt (HPAI H5N1)
An additional human case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has been reported. The patient, who died from the disease, was a 40-year-old woman from Sohag governorate. This marks the third human case in the past three months; the other two patients are under hospitalization. Most cases in Egypt have been detected in impoverished rural areas, where villagers often raise poultry on the rooftops of their homes.
