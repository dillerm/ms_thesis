H5N1 in Poultry in USA (LPAI)
Some birds on a commercial turkey farm of 5,500 in Wright County, Minnesota, tested positive for low pathogenic bird flu. The molecular tests, performed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories on June 29, were a part of routine pre-market testing of healthy birds with no clinical signs of avian influenza. The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the Minnesota Board of Animal Health are conducting a comprehensive epidemiological investigation of this event. Following the State response and containment plan, the Minnesota Board of Animal Health has quarantined the index premises and has established a surveillance zone of three miles. All flocks within the three-mile surveillance zone have been tested and are negative for influenza. So far no virus has been isolated from the turkeys on the farm.
