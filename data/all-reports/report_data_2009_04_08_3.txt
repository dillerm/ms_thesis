H5N1 in Poultry in USA
A Nigerian man travelling through Baltimore Washington International Airport was fined $300 on March 27 for attempting to bring potentially hazardous food items into the United States. The man had a dead bird encased in homemade black soap, 3.6 pounds of beef, 3 pounds of chicken bullion, and one star fruit. Officials were concerned that the poultry products might introduce avian influenza or Newcastle disease to the United States, or that the beef could introduce foot and mouth or mad cow disease. They believe that the man was unaware of the risk that these items posed to the biosecurity of the United States.
