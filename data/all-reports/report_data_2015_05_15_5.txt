USA (HPAI H5N8)
The first case of the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus in Indiana has been reported at a backyard farm in Whitley County housing 77 chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese. The owner had recently purchased some birds and an increased mortality was noted. Samples were submitted for testing and HPAI H5N8 was detected. The farm has been disinfected and placed under quarantine for 21 days, and neighboring farms are being surveyed to ensure the disease hasn't spread.
