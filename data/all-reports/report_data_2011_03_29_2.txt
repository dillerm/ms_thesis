H5N1 in Wild birds in Tasmania
 It was recently reported that low pathogenic avian influenza virus was found in Tasmanian wild ducks that were tested as part of a national surveillance program; however, none of the tests found highly virulent disease-causing avian influence strains.  Department of Primary Industry, Water and Environment senior vet Dr. Bruce Jackson said that the program is an early detection measure to prevent and manage disease, and large scale poultry farmers are currently being advised to maintain their biosecurity. “We know some of these viruses, if they get into large commercial poultry units, there's some types which we know can cause disease in domestic poultry,” he said.
