H5N1 in Poultry in Japan
On November 30, Shimane prefecture began culling 23,000 chickens on a farm because of the discovery of highly pathogenic bird flu virus. Five chickens were found dead on the farm and preliminary tests were positive for avian influenza. Further testing has confirmed the virus is of the H5 subtype. Further characterization has shown the virus to be highly pathogenic, killing 75% of experimentally infected chickens. The amino acid sequence of the hemagglutinin gene  indicate that the virus is identical to the H5N1 virus found in wild bird fecal samples collected in October in Lake Onuma, Hokkaido. The culling was expected to take 2-3 days. In addition a task force has been set up to deal with the possible outbreak. Shimane and neighboring prefectures conducted checks for the virus on 130 farms and disinfected vehicles that travel roads near the infected farm. If the outbreak is confirmed, it will be the first in Japan since 2009.
