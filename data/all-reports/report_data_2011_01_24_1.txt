H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) reported that an oriental magpie robin found dead in Yuen Long on January 17 has tested positive for H5 bird flu. Further tests are being conducted to confirm the result. The Mai Po Nature Reserve (MPNR) and three chicken farms are within three km of the refuse collection point where the bird was found. AFCD staff inspected the farms and found no abnormal mortality or symptoms of bird flu among the chickens. These farms will be put under enhanced surveillance;  the MPNR will remain open to the public but existing precautionary measures will be enhanced. The AFCD will issue letters to farmers, pet bird shop owners, license holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons reminding them that proper precautions must be taken to prevent the spread of bird flu. They will also conduct frequent inspections of farms and markets and continue their surveillance of wild birds.
