Canada (LPAI)
An outbreak of low pathogenic H5N2 bird flu was confirmed on November 23 on a poultry farm in Manitoba. The disease infected 3,000 turkeys on the farm of 7,400. There was no increase in mortality and no respiratory disease was observed. The farm has been quarantined and an investigation into the origin of the outbreak will be conducted. In addition the disease will be stamped out and the premises will be disinfected to prevent the disease from spreading. Preliminary results from the National Center for Foreign Animal Diseases in Winnipeg indicate the presence of a H5N2 subtype avian influenza virus (PCR), but virus isolation is still underway and additional testing is to come, including the intravenous pathogenicity index test.
