Myanmar (HPAI H5N1)
More than 1,400 chickens and 10,000 quail have died from three outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in Monywa District, Sagaing province.  To prevent further spread of the disease, 1,500 chickens and more than 20,000 quail have been culled.  The first outbreak of the virus in Myanmar was in the same region in 2006, but Myanmar has not had a HPAI H5N1 outbreak since 2012.
