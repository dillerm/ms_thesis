H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
Four children from Kecamatan Simpangkatis are being treated in Depati Hamzah regional hospital in a special area for bird flu patients. Bird flu is suspected because the children have experienced sustained high fevers and are known to have had contact with dead poultry. The children were found to be sick during a routine investigation after the death of many chickens in the area. Samples have been collected to diagnose the illness and confirmation is expected within a week. A 36-year-old woman and a 16-month-old boy were treated at Tidar Hospital in Central Java for suspected H5N1 bird flu. Both patients are from Kecamatan. The boy has recovered and been discharged, but the woman is still being treated.
