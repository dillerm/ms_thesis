The Alabama Department of Agriculture and Industries reports that three outbreaks of avian influenza are suspected to have recently occurred in the state (in southeastern USA).  The first two suspected outbreaks occurred prior to 12 March (dates were not reported), and occurred in a commercial chicken flock in Lauderdale County and in a backyard flock in Madison County.  The third suspected outbreak involved samples collected as part of a routine surveillance effort; the samples were taken at a flea market in Jackson County on 12 March.  Samples from all three potential outbreaks are currently being tested.  A precautionary Stop Movement Order has been issued by the Alabama State Veterinarian to preclude the possible spread of the disease. The Madison and Jackson county events are reported as LPAI H7N9 but no official USDA statement has been released on them as yet.
