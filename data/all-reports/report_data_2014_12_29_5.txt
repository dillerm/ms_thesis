Japan (HPAI H5)
The Miyazaki Prefectural Government had slaughtered 42,000 chickens on a farm in the city of Miyazaki after a genetic test of dead fowl confirmed the presence of HPAI H5 bird flu virus. (The NA subtyping is not yet available). Chickens within a radius of 3 km of the outbreak have been prohibited from being moved and shipments of another 1.93 million chickens in areas within 10 km have been banned. Also, the prefecture set up 10 sterilization points on roads around the affected farm. This is the second time a highly pathogenic bird flu strain has been confirmed in Miyazaki prefecture this year. On Dec. 16, the HPAI H5N8 virus was confirmed at a poultry farm in Nobeoka, also in Miyazaki Prefecture, where about 4,000 chickens were culled. It is uncertain whether there is a link between the first outbreak and the second and further testing of the strain will be conducted at a government-backed research institute.
