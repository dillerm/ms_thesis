H5N1 in Humans in Hong Kong
 In relation to the wild bird report for Hong Kong above, the 48-year-old woman who picked up the sick black-headed gull later found infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza, without any protection.  She developed a fever, sore throat, and diarrhea the next day and was admitted to the Princess Margaret Hospital for isolation and laboratory testing.  Her tests produced negative results for the Influenza A virus with all subtypes.  The Public Health Laboratory Services Branch is now conducting tests for bird flu on the womanâ€™s 11-year-old son, who recovered from a fever and cough earlier in the week.  He was also admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital as a precautionary measure, and his test results are currently pending.
