H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
Bird flu has broken out in four locations within the Banke district. Samples were sent to Kathmandu on March 8 after a large number of birds died in the area. As of March 24, more than 50 chickens and other birds had died, and residents in the area expressed concern that the flu would be transmitted to humans. Culling of remaining birds was scheduled for March 25. A rapid response team and a monitoring team have been formed and preventative measures have been stepped up to prevent the spread of the disease.
