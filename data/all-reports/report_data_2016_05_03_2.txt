Iraq (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports new cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in the governorates of Al Qadisiyah, As Sulaymaniyah, Baghdad, Dahuk, and Diyala.  The virus was identified after samples were tested by the Baghdad Central Veterinary Laboratory, Duhuk Laboratory, Erbil Central Veterinary Laboratory, and the Weybridge Laboratory.  A total of 77,101 birds died of the virus, and the remaining 718,599 were culled to prevent further spread.  In addition to culling, further control measures include movement control, screening, disinfection, traceability, quarantine, surveillance, stamping out, zoning, control of wildlife reservoirs, and official destruction of animal products, carcasses, by-products, and waste.  Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 was last detected in Iraq in January 2006, and the source of the outbreak is unknown.
