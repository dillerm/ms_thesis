H5N1 in Humans in UK
The House of Lords in London has released a report that warns the next pandemic is likely to originate from bird flu and could kill 50 million people worldwide. The report notes that 75% of new human disease originates from animals and that diseases are only identified after they infect people. The report calls for a new disease surveillance system in developing countries, including a reorganization of the WHO.
