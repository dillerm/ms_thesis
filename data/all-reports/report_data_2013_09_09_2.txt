Avian Influenza in Poultry in Italy
 Italian health officials have confirmed that a male poultry worker has tested positive for H7N7. Transmission occurred when the worker was exposed to sick poultry while working in contaminated areas. As result of his infection, the worker has contracted conjunctivitis. Italian authorities have culled thousands of birds since the emergence of H7N7 on local farms in August. This recent outbreak is the first in Italian poultry since 2000. Authorities have enacted protection and surveillance zones around the affected farms. Other control measures include movement restrictions on poultry products and ongoing veterinary checks.
