Canada (HPAI H5N2)
A case of the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus has been reported at a turkey farm in Oxford County with 8,000 birds. This marks the third case in southwestern Ontario.  The farm was within a quarantine zone imposed after the virus was discovered at a nearby chicken facility, and scientists are unsure if the virus got past biocontrols or was present before the quarantine was put in place.  To date, over 80,000 birds have died or been destroyed due to the virus.
