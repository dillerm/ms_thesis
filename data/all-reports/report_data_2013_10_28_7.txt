Australia (H7N2)
Australian health officials confirmed a second outbreak of the H7 avian influenza virus on an egg farm in New South Wales earlier this week. This is the second H7 outbreak the state has seen this month. The egg farm is currently under lockdown. Officials believe that the two outbreaks are linked and investigations are underway to test this theory. The New South Wales Food Authority is relaying to the public that it remains safe to eat poultry and eggs.
