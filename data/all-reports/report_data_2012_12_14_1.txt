H5N1 in Wild birds in Russia
Earlier this week, the death of at least 4,000 wild birds in Russia?s southern Krasnodar Krai region since the end of November, was found to be due to an outbreak of H5N1. The government has issued a state of emergency on the entire region and has ordered all poultry farms to cease operating until further notice. Vaccines were delivered to infected farms and 98 percent of the poultry population has been vaccinated. Rosselkhoznadzor, the Russian veterinary watchdog, will continue to inspect all poultry farms in the region to prevent further outbreaks.
