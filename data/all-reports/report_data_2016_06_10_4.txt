Taiwan (HPAI H5N2)
On June 8, 40,864 chickens at a chicken farm in Pingtung County, southern Taiwan, were culled after the farm was confirmed to have been infected with H5 subtype avian influenza. The Pingtung County government has begun monitoring and specimen collection within one kilometer of the chicken farm to make sure neighboring poultry farms are virus-free. The animal health authorities in Tainan, southern Taiwan, reported Saturday a new bird flu case involving a chicken farm in the municipality's Xiaying District.  The farm was sampled for tests May 23, and the test results, released two days later, indicate that it was infected with the H5 avian influenza virus, according to the Animal Health Inspection and Protection Office.  All 13,926 chickens on the farm were culled.
