USA (HPAI H5N2)
Following recent reports of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza spreading from Minnesota to Arkansas and Missouri, it was initially thought that the virus was carried over the migratory route from Minnesota to the Gulf of Mexico by wild birds. However, this theory is doubted by many wildlife experts, as during this time of year birds tend to migrate from south to north, opposite of the direction the infection spread.  Thus far all wild birds collected have tested negative for the virus. If they are determined to be the source, officials are still unsure how the flu strain passed to the Missouri and Arkansas poultry facilities which are entirely indoors.
