H5N1 in Wild birds in Bangladesh
About 1,000 crows have died in Barisal, Patuakhai and Dinajpur districts. It is suspected that the crows are eating Â dead H5N1-infected chickens discarded improperly, such as in canals and ponds. Bangladesh has closed its border with India as the country deals with bird flu which has spread to 30 out of 64 districts. Bangladesh shares a long and porous border with India, which is also struggling to contain an outbreak of H5N1.
