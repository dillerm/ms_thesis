An outbreak of pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus began on a farm in Skogn on October 10. The pigs were probably infected by the owner who had been ill with flu-like symptoms. Pandemic H1N1 (2009) was confirmed in the owner. The pigs exhibited respiratory signs and Pandemic H1N1 has been identified as the cause of illness in the pigs by testing at the National Veterinary Institute. All 415 animals on the farm were culled as a precautionary measure.
