USA (HPAI H5N2)
The U.S. Department of Agriculture has reported cases of HPAI H5N2 in poultry flocks in Minnesota, South Dakota, and Montana. The fourth and fifth confirmed cases in Minnesota occurred in a commercial turkey farm with 21,000 birds in Nobles County and a turkey farm with 71,000 birds in Stearns County. On April 2, the first case of HPAI H5N2 in South Dakota was confirmed in commercial turkey flock of 53,000 birds in Beadle County. HPAI H5N2 was confirmed on April 2 in a backyard mixed-poultry flock in Judith Basin County, Montana. The flocks have been quarantined and will be culled, and nearby farms will be checked. The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has been looking for signs of HPAI H5N2 in wild birds in the areas around the affected Minnesota farms, but has so far found no evidence of the virus.
