China (LPAI H7N9)
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health has reported three additional human cases of low pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza.  The patients include a 36-year-old woman from Guangdong Province, and two men aged 50 and 68 from Anhui Province. All three had contact with poultry and are currently in critical condition.  To date, 596 human cases of H7N9 have been reported by health authorities, with 179 cases in Guangdong alone.  To prevent the virus from spreading, health surveillance measures, such as thermal imaging systems, are in place for body temperature checks on inbound travelers.  CHP urges people to avoid contact with live poultry and their droppings.
