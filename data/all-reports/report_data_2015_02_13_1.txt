South Korea (HPAI H5N8)
According to officials, the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus was confirmed from the feces of migratory birds at Jungnangcheon (Jungnan Stream) in the capital city of Seoul.  The stream is a habitat for more than 4,200 wild birds, with another 600 birds residing in a nearby national park.  The Seoul Metropolitan Government has blocked access to the stream and put quarantine measures in place.  In addition, all bird exhibits at zoos have been closed temporarily, and disinfection and monitoring will be tightened.  More than 1.8 million birds have been culled in the country since the disease broke out in December, but this is the first time the disease has been detected in Seoul.
