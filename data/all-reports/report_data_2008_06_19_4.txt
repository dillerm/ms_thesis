H5N1 in Humans in Hong Kong
A Hygiene Department contractor who reported flu-like symptoms in Hong Kong has been cleared of being infected with avian influenza.  The man was hired to help clean the Po On Road market after H5N1 was found in three of the seven market stalls in early June.  He developed a fever and respiratory symptoms, but has tested negative for H5N1, and appears to have influenza B.
