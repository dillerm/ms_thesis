H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
Two patients, a nine year old and a two year old, have tested positive for H5N1.  The first patient, from Riau Province, fell ill in November, but was hospitalized and released after a full recovery.  Officials had found dead poultry at her home earlier that month.  The second patient developed symptoms mid-November but died later that month in East Jakarta.  The source of the infection was traced to a live bird market.  Indonesia continues to have high numbers of H5N1 cases and has recorded 113 total fatalities to date.(more...)
