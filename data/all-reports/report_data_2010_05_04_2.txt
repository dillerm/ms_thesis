H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
Three new outbreaks were reported. An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu began April 13 on a poultry farm in Quang Ninh province. Of 900 birds housed on the farm, half  died from the disease and the rest were culled. On April 22, H5N1 bird flu broke out on a local duck farm in Quang Tri province. According to the Department of Animal Health, the farm housed 1,500 ducks and 250 died from the disease. A third outbreak began April 24 on a farm in Quang Ngai province. Of 3,520 birds living on the farm, 150 died and the rest were culled. The origins of these outbreaks may have been the introduction of new live animals, illegal movement of animals, or fomites. Measures including the slaughter of infected animals, quarantine, movement control inside the country, and sterilization of affected areas have been taken to prevent the spread of the virus. There are also plans to begin screening and zoning.
