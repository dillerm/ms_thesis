A new outbreak of bird flu has killed 350 chickens at a household farm in Tan Nhuan Dong commune in the Mekong delta province. The Department of Animal Health said that specimens have tested positive for H5N1. Another outbreak has occurred in Nghe An province where 30 chickens and 160 ducks died at a local farm. A nearby veterinary agency detected bird flu from the samples and the remaining animals have been culled. The last outbreak of H5N1 in Vietnam was last week at a poultry farm in Long An province.
