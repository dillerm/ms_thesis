USA (HPAI H5N2)
Since it was first discovered in Pope County, Minnesota in early March, the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenze virus has continued to spread.  To date, nine states have been affected, with the Minnesota turkey industry particularly at risk, since turkeys are highly susceptible to the virus.  The virus usually takes only two to four days to spread through a barn.  Minnesota alone has lost over 900,000 birds to the virus, with the biggest outbreak affecting 310,000 birds at a farm in Meeker County owned by Hormel Foods.  The virus is believed to have been tracked from Asian waterfowl over the Bering Strait, where it mixed with a North American low-pathogenic strain.
