H5N1 in Poultry in Niger
Officials have placed the country on ?high alert? following avian influenza outbreaks in neighboring Nigeria where several thousand poultry are reported dead. The Ministry of Livestock in Niger raised the alert for the 1,500 km border adjacent to Nigerian states Kano, Kebbi and Katsina where the deaths occurred at the end of July. Samples of the dead birds have been sent to a laboratory in Italy to be tested for H5N1.
