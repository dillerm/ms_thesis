H5N1 in Wild Birds in Germany
A bird, possibly a black-necked grebe (Podiceps nigricollis),  found near a pond in the town of Kelbra in central Germany, has tested positive  for H5N1.  The extent of the outbreak may be larger, as over a hundred  wild birds have recently died on the artificial lake located on the border of  Thuringia and Saxony-Anhaltne;  news reports suggest that up to 38 of them  tested positive for H5N1. Last week, Germany announced that 9 wild birds tested  positive for H5N1, six in the southern state of Bavaria and three in the  eastern state of Saxony.
