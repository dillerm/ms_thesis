USA Canine Influenza (H3N8)
A canine flu outbreak has sickened at least 1,000 dogs in Illinois, Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana.  Tests have identified the both a new strain of H3N2 that has shown up for the first time from Asia and the H3N8 strain that has circulated in the US since 2004.  Both viruses cause persistent coughing, runny nose and fever, and the H3N2 strain has been associated with some deaths.  Veterinarians say neither strain is related to bird flu.
