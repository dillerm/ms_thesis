H5N1 in Wild birds in UK
The Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) released a report on November 29 that suggests that wild birds may have been the source in the recent H5N1 outbreak on Suffolk area farms. (See news article about report) Although none of the wild birds tested in the area have been positive for H5N1, Fred Landeg, the Acting Chief Veterinary Officer said that wild birds cannot be ruled out as a source of the outbreak.  "We have no other evidence of any other route of infection to this premises to date (other than wild birds)," he said. The initial report by DEFRA found no evidence that the virus was introduced by infected poultry, poultry products, vehicles or people from countries with existing disease. Landeg did acknowledge that poor biosecurity practices lead to the transmssion from Redgrave Park farm to Hill Meadow Farm.
