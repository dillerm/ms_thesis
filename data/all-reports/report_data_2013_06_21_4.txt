Taiwanâ€™s disease control authority confirmed its first human infection of H6N1 on Friday, the 21st of June. The victim, a 20-year-old woman from central Taiwan, was initially diagnosed with pneumonia, with tests later showing that the virus was low pathogenic H6N1. The woman has already made a full recovery, and of the 36 people she had close contact with, four showed flu-like symptoms, but none of them tested positive for the virus. The source of the outbreak remains unknown, the patient has not traveled out of the country and did not have a history of poultry exposure. Officials are urging people to avoid feeding and touching live birds and to stay away from open markets with live poultry.
