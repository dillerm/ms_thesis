USA (HPAI H5N2) in Iowa
A new outbreak of H5N2 avian influenza has been detected at a farm in Osceola County, Iowa.  The farm has about 25 barns and a total of 3.8 million chickens, nearly 10 percent of the egg-laying hens in the state.  Birds in three of the barns have been killed so far to stop to spread of the virus, but the birds in all the barns are planned to be culled.
