Highly pathogenic H7N1 bird flu broke out at a farm for layer hens in Guadalajara on September 10. The strain was confirmed by testing at the Central Veterinary Laboratory in Algete. The farm contained 308,640 birds, of which 30,000 died of the virus and the rest were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. A 3-km protection zone and a 10-km surveillance zone have been established around the farm and there are clinical inspections on other farms in the area. The farm equipment has been destroyed along with the bird carcasses that could transmit the virus.
