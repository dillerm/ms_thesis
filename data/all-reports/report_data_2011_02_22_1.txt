H1N1
A 6-year-old domestic cat in Wisconsin tested positive for H1N1 flu virus. This is the first confirmed case of the disease in a pet in the United States since January 2010. The cat and a 10-year-old cat from the same household were taken to a veterinary emergency hospital for respiratory distress. The second cat tested negative for the disease, but it is thought that test returned a false negative because the shedding period for influenza viruses is short. Both cats were euthanized after treatment failed to improve their condition. The owner had been sick with flu symptoms before the cats became ill. The AVMA encourages pet owners to monitor their petâ€™s health closely and take them to a vet for any signs of illness.
