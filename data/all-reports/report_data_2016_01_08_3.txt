Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports an additional case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus on a poultry farm in the state of Enugu. This diagnosis was confirmed after testing at the National Veterinary Research Institute came back positive for the virus. A total of 25,000 16 week old layers died from the disease, and the remaining 95,000 birds were culled to prevent further spread of the disease. Further control measures include movement control, disinfection, quarantine, surveillance, modified stamping out, and official disposal of carcasses, waste, animal products and by-products. The source of this outbreak is unknown, but poor farm biosecurity was observed.
