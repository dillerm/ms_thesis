H1N1 in animals in France
Tests at AFSSA (French Agency for Food Safety) laboratory confirmed that turkeys on a breeder farm in northeastern France were infected with the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus. The farmers became concerned about the health of the flock when they noticed a significant drop in egg production. Approximately 3,000 of the 8,600 birds on the farm had the illness, but there were no mortalities, and the sick birds recovered fully. The farm will continue to be quarantined for 7 days after clinical signs disappear as a preventative measure. The origin of the outbreak is unknown.
