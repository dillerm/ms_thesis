H5N1 in Wild birds in Romania
Romania’s National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority has declared that the avian influenza outbreak that began in November is over. Poultry in the index village of Murighiol, and the entire area of Tulcea County, were inspected for infection. Because the village is in the Danube delta, the Veterinary Authority also tested the wild bird population. A total of 2,700 blood and tracheal samples were found negative.
