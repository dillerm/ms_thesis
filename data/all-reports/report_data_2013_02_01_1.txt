H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
 An outbreak of H5N1 was reported earlier this week in Tuen Mun in the New Territories, Hong Kong.  A black-headed gull, found dead at Mouse Island childrenâ€™s playground as part of an ongoing surveillance program on wild birds,  tested positive for the deadly H5N1 bird flu virus at the Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory, Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department.  No spread of the disease is apparent.  To prevent further outbreaks, various control measures are being applied including screening and disinfection of contaminated areas.  Additionally, national surveillance will continue on poultry farms, markets, and pet bird shops around the country.
