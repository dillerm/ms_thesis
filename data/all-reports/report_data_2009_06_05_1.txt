New Host Species.
Thirteen giant anteaters in a zoo in Tennessee caught the H1N1 flu strain â€“ the human type, not the new swine flu. It was not previously known that anteaters were susceptible to the virus, but scientists who study influenza are not surprised because the virus adapts easily. The zoo staff initially noticed that the anteaters were lethargic, had loss of appetite, and had nasal discharge. They were uncertain of the cause so they tested for everything and were surprised to find human influenza. They believe that the disease transferred from the primary caregiver to the animals as the animals were housed in a separate area with no contact with other animals with a separate staff, but it is unclear whether they all contracted it from the caregiver or it passed from anteater to anteater. All of the anteaters survived the outbreak. Although it is unlikely that anteaters are a reservoir of influenza in the wild because of their small numbers, this outbreak has scientists wondering if there might be reservoirs other than birds and pigs that have yet to be studied.
