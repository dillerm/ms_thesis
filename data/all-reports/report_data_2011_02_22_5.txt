H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
A total of 50 chickens from 13 households in East Java have died. The Livestock Service examined the dead chickens, which had been buried, and the carcasses tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. Afterward, local poultry were disinfected. So far no human cases have arisen, but the Livestock Service requested people to report any sign of illness such as chills or high fever.
