H5N1 in Wild birds in Nepal
 Dr. Nar Bahadur Rajwar, Director of the Department of Livestock Service, has reported that the migration of birds from Siberia has resulted in the transmission of bird flu to domestic fowls in Nepal.  There have been at least 11 HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in poultry since the beginning of 2013. It is unclear what was the basis of Dr. Rajwarâ€˜s contention.
