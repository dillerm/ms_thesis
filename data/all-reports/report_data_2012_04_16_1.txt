H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
Hundreds of chickens smuggled from East Java to Bali were found by quarantine officials in the baggage hold of an inter-province bus. Rapid tests on some of the birds were positive for H5N1 bird flu. The birds were culled but their owner was not arrested because he had not travelled on the bus. The birds were suspected of being intended for markets in Denpasar. Wahyu Savitri, the executive head of the Gilimanuk quarantine office, said that smuggling of poultry is rife in Bali and that three attempts have already been foiled this year. Bird flu has so far been detected nine districts and municipalities in Bali.
