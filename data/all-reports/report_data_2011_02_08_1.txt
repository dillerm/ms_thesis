H5N1 in Wild birds in Japan
This winter H5N1 bird flu has been spreading through Japan at an unprecedented rate. The route of infection has not been established in all cases, but it is highly likely that migratory birds from the north were carriers of the infectious disease. The outbreaks in Kagoshima and Shimani prefectures both took place near wintering grounds of migratory birds. The disease has a ten day incubation period in wild birds allowing them to travel great distances before they become ill. It is thought that small birds became infected from the droppings of migratory birds and carried the disease to the farms. The origin of the outbreaks in Aichi prefecture has not yet been determined.In Tottori prefecture, further testing confirmed H5N1 in a tufted duck and a hooded gull found ill last month. No signs of infection have been found in nearby poultry farms. Detailed tests in Hokkaido confirmed H5N1 in a whooper swan that had been found dead in mid-January.
