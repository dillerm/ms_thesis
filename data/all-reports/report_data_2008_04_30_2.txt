H5N1 in Poultry in India
Bird flu has been confirmed for a second and third time in the remote northeastern state of Tripura. Eight villages in Tripura, on the Bangladesh border, were affected earlier this month and over 25,000 ducks and chickens have been culled, but the new outbreaks in the villages of Kalachari and Nadilad are located just 40 km, according to a senior animal resource official. H5N1 has been detected in birds from Kalachari, located 130 km from the state capital of Agartala. Tripura's animal resource commissioner said: “Kalachari is just a few metres from the Bangladesh border. We believe illegal trade or movement of poultry between Kalachari and Bangladesh may have caused the virus to return to the state."  In Nadilad, H5N1 was detected in samples from dead birds.
