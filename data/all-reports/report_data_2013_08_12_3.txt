Nepal (H5N1)
Nepalese health officials confirmed six new outbreaks of H5N1 earlier this week, raising the total number of outbreaks to 32 in the past 21 days.  During this three week stretch, health officials have culled over 220,000 chickens and destroyed more than 400,000 eggs at the 30 affected farms in the Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur districts.  In hopes to prevent the disease from spreading to both humans and other poultry, officials have imposed a week-long ban on the distribution and sale of chickens throughout Nepal.  The head of the Kathmandu District Animal Health Office hopes that this measure will “save both human lives as well as the industry.”
