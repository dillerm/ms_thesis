South Korea (H5N8)
Highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza was detected in the province of Jeju and North Jeolla, South Korea. A farmer on Jeju Island had purchased five silkie chickens from a local ?traditional? market and added them to his backyard flock. They all died over the next two days, but the deaths were un-reported until other chickens began to die. HPAI H5N8 was detected in the samples collected from his farm. The silkies originate from a farm in Gunsan, North Jeolla province, which has sold birds to Gyeonggi and South Gyeongsang in addition to Jeju province. Roughly 12,000 chickens and ducks in a 3 km radius of the index farm in Jeju and 13,400 chickens in North Jeolla have been culled since the confirmation of the virus. Other locations are being tested. The Korean government has prohibited all sales of live poultry in the country as of June 5, 2017 and raised the bird flu warning level.
