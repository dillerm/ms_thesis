H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
In an effort to stem the spread of bird flu, the capitol of Jakarta plans to abolish live poultry markets by 2010. The Jakarta Husbandry and Fisheries Agency plans to have six poultry processing plants relocated to the outskirts of the city. These plants will be eligible to slaughter and process poultry for sale in traditional markets, in place of the 700 smaller farms currently raising and processing chickens inside the city. Jakarta citizens consume around 700,000 chickens daily, most raised outside the city limits from neighboring Tangerang and Bekasi districts.
