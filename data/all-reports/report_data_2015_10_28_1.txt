Taiwan (HPAI H5N2)
The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported two additional cases of the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus, one on a farm in Yunlin County and the second at a slaughterhouse in Taoyan County in Taiwan.  In the farm case, 681 turkeys died and the remaining 992 were culled prevent further spread of the virus. In addition to culling, the farm has been disinfected, put under movement restriction, and poultry farms in a 3 km radius are under increased surveillance.  The source of the outbreak is unknown.  In the slaughterhouse case, no birds died; the disease was discovered by post-mortem inspection and testing.  In response, 570 of the 927 geese were culled, the carcasses were destroyed and the facility disinfected.  The farm where the birds are thought to have originated is also being tested. On Oct 24, the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) has reported that 495 chickens have died on a farm in Changhua County from H5N2 infection.  To prevent further spread of the disease the remaining 20,000 chickens will be culled and biosecurity measures will be strengthened.  The source of the outbreak is thought to be a resurgence of an earlier outbreak or infection from migrating birds.
