H5N1 in Poultry in Kuwait:
The first cases of H5N1 in broiler chickens in  Kuwait have been reported.  The Public Authority for Agriculture Affairs  and Fish Resources has destroyed 180,000 eggs and 250 tons of fodder on eight  farms that tested positive for bird flu.  The new outbreaks were also in  the Wafra area, a region where many H5N1-positive premises have been previously  identified.
