H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
 In the Nam Dinh province of Vietnam, late last month and early this month, six outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza have been reported in different villages across the province.  A total of 7,702 birds were potentially affected and culled to prevent the spread of the disease.  The source of these outbreaks remains unknown.  Control measures applied include quarantine, movement control, and disinfection, while control measures yet to be applied include screening and zoning to monitor any possible future outbreaks.
