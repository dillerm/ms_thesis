Romania (HPAI H5N1)
On March 30, the National Sanitary Veterinary and Food Safety Authority of Romania reported an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 among a colony of approximately 250 Dalmatian pelicans on Ceaplace Island, Sinoe Lake, at the border of Tulcea and Constanta Counties.  Local officials discovered and reported 64 dead birds on March 25, and no other birds in the area were observed to have clinical signs.  Control measures applied include control of wildlife reservoirs, screening, and zoning.  The source of the outbreak is unknown. An additional 108 pelicans have died at the colony and “bird flu” is suspected as the cause.
