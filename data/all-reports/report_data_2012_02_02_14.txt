H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
A 2-year-old boy from the Banteay Meanchey province died January 18 due to the H5N1 bird flu virus. On January 3, the boy fell ill, and on January 9, he was admitted to Siem Reap hospital for treatment. He is thought to have contracted the disease after coming into contact with sick poultry in his village. Kao Sopheaktra, director of the provincial health department, stated residents in the same commune as the infected boy ate chickens that had died from unknown causes and encouraged the residents to seek immediate medical treatment if they became ill. Officials will be monitoring the health of the boyâ€™s relatives and other villagers for the next 2 weeks and will be testing poultry in the area for highly pathogenic avian influenza.
