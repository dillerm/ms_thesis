H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
 At the end of November, hundreds of chickens and ducks were culled by Nepalese health workers after an outbreak of bird flu was reported in the capital city, Kathmandu.  The outbreak was discovered after a poultry farmer told health officials that 90 of his chickens had died suddenly. Government health official, Narayan Prasad Ghimire, stated over 500 chickens and ducks were slaughtered along with the disposal of dozens of eggs and poultry feed.  He went on to say that a rapid response team was mobilized in the infected area on the outskirts of the city to prevent the spread of the virus to other parts of the city.In addition, more than 1,000 chickens have died at various poultry farms in the Udayapur District of Nepal in the past week. The chickens began dying at two local farms in the village of Ghurmi Bazaar and then spread affecting other parts of the village. The cause of death of the chickens could not be diagnosed at the Regional Livestock Health office, so samples were sent to Kathmandu to be tested.  Following the deaths, export of chickens from Udayapur to other districts has been banned.
