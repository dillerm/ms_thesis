Avian Influenza in Poultry (HPAI/H5N8) in South Korea
According to the South Joella Livestock Sanitation Office in Hampyeong County, the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu virus was discovered at a duck farm in Hampyeong.  The virus was first detected on July 25 when officials from the sanitation office conducted a test before approving the farmâ€™s products for sale, and was confirmed a few days later by the Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Rural Affairs.  Officials were surprised at the outbreak as it occurred in the middle of summer and influenza is typically transmitted during the cooler months of the year, but it came only a month after outbreaks in the city of Daegu and Gangwan-do province.  In addition to immediately culling approximately 42,000 ducks at the farm and slaughtering an additional 2,000 chickens at nearby poultry farms, all farms within 10 kilometers were ordered to cease transporting animals for 30 days.
