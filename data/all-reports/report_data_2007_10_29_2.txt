H5N1 in Wild birds in Germany
Reuters reported on October 25 that bird flu may become endemic in parts of Europe. "It seems that a new chapter in the evolution of avian influenza may be unfolding silently in the heart of Europe," Joseph Domenech, chief veterinary officer of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said in a statement. The statement came after German scientists detected H5N1 in dead domestic ducks which had appeared to be healthy. Domenech said that H5N1 may become endemic in parts of Europe, such as the Black Sea area, because domestic ducks and geese are more of a vector in the spread of bird flu than previously thought.
