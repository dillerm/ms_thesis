The Netherlands (HPAI H5N8)
Dutch authorities have identified the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza at a poultry farm in the village of Hekendorp.  150,000 hens were destroyed.  In March, some 10,000 chickens were destroyed after bird flu was found at a farm in the eastern province of Gelderland.  This is the same strain that prompted massive culls in Asia. A second case of bird flu was detected on a farm at Ter Aar containing 43,000 chickens, NVWA said Thursday.  The outbreak was of the H5 strain, but tests are still underway to determine if it was of the highly pathogenic variety.  Authorities have placed a 10 km cordon around the farm and are testing nearby farms.  The farm will be disinfected and the chickens destroyed.  A 72 hour nationwide ban on the transport of all poultry and related products has also been put into place.
