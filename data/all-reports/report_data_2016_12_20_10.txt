Macao SAR (LPAI H7N9)
On December 14, H7N9 avian influenza was detected in samples from a shipment of live chickens at a wholesale chicken market in Macao; 10,000 birds (including chickens and pigeons) were culled to prevent the spread of the virus.  The market was closed for three days as a precautionary measure, and the site has been disinfected.  Two people had contacts with the infected birds (see the next section for further details).
