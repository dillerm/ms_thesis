H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
 It is highly suspected that a 30-year-old male resident of Desa Karangsari RT3 RW2, Kecamatan Adipala, Cilacap Timur, Central Java Province who died on April 14 had H5N1 bird flu virus. The victim became sick on April 7 and eventually developed severe breathing difficulty, fever and other bird flu-like signs; hospital diagnosis showed pneumonia or lung infection, high fever and low thrombocyte count.  Investigation showed that, prior to becoming sick, the victim was exposed to hundreds of birds, such as chickens, ducks and swans that died in his neighborhood; a rapid test showed those birds were positive for H5N1 bird flu. The Head of Health Service of Kabupaten Cilacap, Bambang Setyono, said victimâ€™s lung liquid has been sent to Kariadi hospital in Semarang, and the test result is expected within a week.  Health Service and Livestock Service are currently conducting further epidemiological investigation on this case.
