China (H7N9)
 Chinese officials confirmed two new cases of the H7N9 virus so far this month.  To date, a total of 136 human cases have been confirmed in China since the first human infection in late March.  The victims, a 35-year-old man and a 67-year-old man, are both from the Zhejiang Province.  Officials are concerned that the fall and winter months may bring an increase in respiratory diseases, like the flu, and are urging the public to be on high alert near live poultry to help combat the spread of the virus.  Additionally, the borders are being closely monitored and health information is being distributed to travelers throughout the country.  For more information, see the.
