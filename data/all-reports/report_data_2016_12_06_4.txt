Germany (HPAI H5N8, LPAI H5)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports that a gull was found dead in Potsdam-Mittelmark, Brandenburg State, northwestern Germany, on November 25.  In addition, the Senate Department for Consumer Protection reports that as of November 25, at least six swans and seagulls found dead in the Berlin area have tested positive for avian influenza (some of which have been confirmed infected with the H5N8 strain).  There is debate about the source of the Berlin outbreak: some believe the virus was transmitted in food provided recreationally by humans, while others attribute it to contact with other wild birds.  Poultry stabling is required in the affected area, and dogs and cats must be kept on leashes.
