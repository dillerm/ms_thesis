USA (HPAI H5N2, H5N8)
Olympia, WA. State and federal officials may ask waterfowl hunters in Clark Thurston, Snohomish, Skagit and Whatcom counties in Washington for samples from birds they have harvested to test for avian influenza. Thousands of chickens and domestic turkeys in British Columbia have died from the virus and it has been detected in wild birds in Washington. A genetically nearly identical H5N8 infected domestic guinea fowl has been confirmed in Oregon. More than 10,000 wild birds were tested for bird flu viruses from 2005 to 2011, and bird flu viruses were found in about 10 percent, but none are related to the current HPAI H5N2/H5N8 viruses. Canadian inspectors first confirmed the highly pathogenic H5N2 strain of avian influenza virus at two British Columbia poultry farms during the first week of December. Aware of that finding, WDFW had two birds - a gyrfalcon and northern pintail duck - that died in Whatcom County tested for bird flu the following week. The gyrfalcon, used for hunting and fed on an American wigeon by its owner, was found to have a highly pathogenic H5N8 form of the virus. The northern pintail was found dead at Wiser Lake was infected with a H5N2 virus that was similar to the strain found in poultry in British Columbia.
