H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
 In the Bhaktapur District of Nepal, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza was reported November 2 at a commercial layer farm. Out of 2,000 birds, 1,220 died from the disease, while the remaining 780 were culled and 150 crates of eggs were destroyed to prevent the spread of infection.  Although the source of this outbreak remains unknown, the farmâ€™s poultry was tested for bird flu after egg production slowed, irregularities in egg shape and size increased, and a high mortality rate of poultry were recorded. All associated bird products have been destroyed, while the affected location has been disinfected. Other control measures include quarantine, movement control, screening, dipping and spraying, as well as surveillance throughout the country.
