H5N1 in Humans in Iraq
On February 25, Ihsan Jaafar, an official in the Iraqi Ministry of Health's Epidemic Disease Commission, reported that 142 cases of “avian flu (H5N1)” virus have been recorded in the country this winter. He said that the Ministry was concerned about the spread of bird flu in remote areas of the country, and that “Mountain areas and areas close to water are the most in danger of suffering a flu pandemic." The Director of Veterinary Services in Baghdad, Basem Adhadh, said that Jaafar’s report was highly erroneous, as the influenza strain concerned in Iraq is H1N1 and not the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu.
