Taiwan (H6N1)
The Taipei Times has reported that dogs are now susceptible to the H6N1 strain of avian influenza. The discovery was made a few years ago by Wang Ching-ho, a professor at the National Taiwan University School of Veterinary Science.  According to the story, the Taiwanese government doesn?t view the strain, or the fact that it has infected dogs, as a threat to humans, noting that it has been circulating in chicken farms for decades.  One journalist, however, has accused the government of putting the nation at risk by downplaying the danger posed by the H6N1 if it were to mutate, something that the influenza virus has begun to do in Taiwan.
