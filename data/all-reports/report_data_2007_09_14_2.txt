H5N1 in Poultry in Germany
Some infected ducks may have entered the food supply. H5N1 was detected in 19 frozen duck carcasses set aside as batch samples at a slaughtering house in Wachenroth. The Bavarian consumer affairs minister Roland Eichhorn said that he could not eliminate the possibility that some of the infected meat had reached shops. Also in Germany, two farms about 140 km north of Munich culled over 170,000 ducks after tests found antibodies to H5N1. The animals were not ill, but routine testing detected the presence of the virus. The authorities have not said how the virus was introduced, but both farms belong to the same company that owned another farm in Wachenroth where H5N1 was found two weeks ago.
