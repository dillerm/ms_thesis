USA (LPAI H7N2)
On December 15, officials announced that low-pathogenic H7N2 avian influenza has infected at least 45 cats at an animal shelter in Manhattan, New York.  One older cat with other health problems has died; all other cats have only mild respiratory symptoms and are being kept in a quarantine area.  The virus has not been found in any of the shelter’s dogs, and testing is ongoing for other animal species housed there.
