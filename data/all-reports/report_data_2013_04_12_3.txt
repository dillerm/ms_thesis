H5N1 in Poultry in China
 The World Animal Health Organization OIE reported earlier this week that the H7N9 virus has been detected in five markets throughout the eastern part of China, including markets in the Jiangsi, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces, and in the city of Shanghai.  To date, a total of 9 markets, including three in Shanghai have been affected with the virus.  To help prevent the spread of further disease, Shanghai has banned the sale of all live poultry, 20,536 birds have been culled, and markets are being closed temporarily.
