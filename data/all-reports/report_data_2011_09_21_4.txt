H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
 On the Indonesian island of Java, a village recently encountered an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu among chickens. In the outbreak, 41 chickens died, and when the birds tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza, the Participatory Disease Surveillance and Response team conducted control measures of disinfection, burning and burial of the dead chickens, and vitamin administration to healthy chickens. The source of infection is thought to be from travelling chicken sellers. Similarly, an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in August in a different village on Java was due to chickens purchased that had not been submitted for quarantine inspection.
