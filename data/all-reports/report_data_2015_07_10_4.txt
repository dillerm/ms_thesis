Although there have been no new avian influenza outbreaks in three weeks, top veterinary officials with the U.S. Department of Agriculture say it will take increased surveillance, improved farm security, and more money to avoid a return of the disease in the fall. It is believed that waterfowl carry the virus and dropped it over Midwestern farms during the spring migration north. Hotter, dryer weather kills the virus, but scientists worry it could returned with the cooler weather in fall and southward migration. In a hearing held by the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee, the USDA said it has developed a plan to handle cases at up to 500 farms in all 20 states with major poultry flocks. The plan includes increased surveillance of wild birds and working with industry groups to improve biosecurity, including controlling movement of staff between barns, cleaning equipment more thoroughly, and training personnel on how the virus spreads. The government has also approved hiring 460 temporary positions, including 300 veterinarians and animal technicians, to respond more quickly to outbreaks. Work on a vaccine for the virus is still underway.
