Australia (HPAI H7N2)
 The New South Wales Department of Primary Industries has confirmed that about 2,000 chickens have died of the H7 virus and an additional 400,000 were at risk at a commercial egg-layer farm in Young, New South Wales.  Veterinarians believe that the chickens most likely contracted the virus from wild ducks as the disease was first noticed in the free range flocks and then subsequently in the caged layer flocks. To prevent the virus from spreading further, the infected farm has been quarantined and other farms in the area are being tested.  Additionally, bird movement has been halted throughout the country.
