H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
Chickens that were smuggled into Lang Son province from China have tested positive for bird flu. Eight of 16 poultry were positive for the virus, so many Northern provinces, including Lang Son, have set up checkpoints along the border with China to stop the thriving trade of smuggling poultry.  According to the director of the Lang Son Animal Health Department, over 200 metric tons of poultry were smuggled into Vietnam in 2008.
