Cambodia (H5N1)
The World Health Organization and the Cambodian Health Ministry confirmed two new human cases of H5N1 earlier this week. The latest victims, a nine-year-old boy from the Battambang province, and a five-year-old girl from the Kandal province, both had contact with sick or dead poultry before becoming ill. The Cambodian Health Minister is urging parents and guardians to keep their children away from sick or dead poultry and to wash their hands frequently as they are at a very high risk of contracting the virus. This year, there have been 16 cases of H5N1 in Cambodia alone, 11 resulting in death.
