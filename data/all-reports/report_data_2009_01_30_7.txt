H5N1 in Humans in Nepal
Panic spread in the capital city of Kathmandu this week after some media sources reported that two people admitted to a hospital were suspected of being infected with bird flu. This was denied by the director of the B.P. Koirala Institute of Health Science, who said the patients, who were admitted on January 22nd had pneumonia, not bird flu. One patient was a member of a bird culling team and the second was a veterinarian.
