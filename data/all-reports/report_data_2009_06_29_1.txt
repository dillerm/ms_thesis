Argentina
An outbreak of H1N1 began on June 15 and affected 1676 of 5586 pigs on a commercial farm in Argentina. Diagnostic tests at the Malbr√°n Institute confirmed H1N1. The farm has biosecurity measures in place and its own restocking system, no new animals have been introduced since July 2008, and animals only leave the farm for slaughter. It is believed that farm workers who showed clinical signs of flu June 7 - 9 but did not seek medical care may have infected the pigs. The establishment was disinfected and the animals were quarantined to prevent the spread of H1N1. No animals have shown clinical signs of flu since June 24, but they are still being monitored.
