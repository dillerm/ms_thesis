H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
On April 7 the chairman of the Yen Hung district Peopleâ€™s Committee announced a new outbreak of bird flu in his district of Quang Ninh province. The committee is calling for urgent measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Local farmers claim that vaccination did not protect their flocks from infection with bird flu. The Veterinary Department has introduced measures to quarantine infected areas, sterilize breeding farms, and ban the transport and trading of sick poultry.
