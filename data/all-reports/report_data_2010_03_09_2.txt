H5N1 in Wild birds in South Korea
The South Korean government announced on February 26 that it will strengthen measures to prevent and combat bird flu in anticipation of migratory birds arriving in the country. Recent outbreaks in other Southeast Asian countries have caused the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries to plan ahead in case the virus spreads to local chickens and ducks through the migratory birds. Precautions will include monitoring migratory birds in Heuksan and Hong islands in the Yellow Sea, decontaminating vehicles that carry poultry, and encouraging farmers to implement sterilization procedures twice a week.
