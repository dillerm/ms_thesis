Canada (HPAI H5N1)
 The Alberta woman who died in early January after contracting the H5N1 virus may have caught it at an illegal live bird market. Beijing's Centre for Disease Prevention and Control hypothesizes the contraction occurred while the patient was on a visit to Beijing and passed through an illegal live bird market.  Live bird markets, although illegal in Beijing since 2005, are customary and remain open throughout the municipality illegally.  Chinese officials are testing the area around the former bird market to confirm the source of the infection.
