H5N1 in Domestic Animals
H5N1 remains a major problem in Nigeria, with reported cases increasing   from three states to 10, and now "almost all the states have been having a   recurrence" according to Veterinary Association spokesman Bala Modammed.   Â Details of the outbreaks are lacking, but three recent outbreaks have been   reported by the UN. Samples have tested positive for H5N1 from the southern   state of Delta; the western state of Kwara, which borders Benin; and the   northeastern state of Borno, which borders Chad, Cameroon, and Niger.
