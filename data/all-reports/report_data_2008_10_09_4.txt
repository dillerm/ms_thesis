H5N1 in Poultry in Germany
A duck at a farm in Goerlitz near the Polish border in eastern Germany has tested positive for H5N1. The farm has more than 1,000 birds, including turkeys and geese, and the Social Affairs Ministry in the eastern state of Saxony says it has been sealed off. Officials at Germany's national animal healthy laboratory in Riems said the finding was "somewhat surprising" as the country's alert level had been reduced to moderate and none of the neighboring countries have reported any H5N1. Germany had not seen a case of bird flu since December, 2007.
