Avian Influenza in Humans in China (H7N9)
Highly pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza was reported in a man in Bayan Nur City, Wuyuan County, Inner Mongolia on May 31, 2017. This is Mongolia's first H7N9 confirmed human infection, but the virus is likely to have been in the self-administered region (SAR) earlier because a female farmer who from Ordos, Inner Mongolia but lives in Yulin was infected with the H7N9 virus. According to the patient?s epidemiological history, it is inferred that the source of the infection is possibly poultry. The man is in stable condition.
