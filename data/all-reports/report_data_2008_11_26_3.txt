H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
17 people from the same neighborhood in Sulawesi district were tested for bird flu November 13th. All 17 were placed in isolation wards in the regional hospital. An initial hospital test of the patient's blood samples was positive for H5N1 and the samples were also tested positive by the Hasanuddin University School of Medicine. The hospital did not officially use these test results, but deferred to test results from the Health Ministry. All of those tests were negative, the Ministry of Health said on November 20th, and this week all 17 people have been officially cleared. However early in the week, chickens were found dead in the neighborhood where the people lived and have been confirmed as being positive for bird flu. Both the chicken sellers and the buyers are objecting to Jakarta?s plans to close 1,200 stalls in the city by 2010. An owner at the Tanah Abang market in Central Jakarta said that his customers want to see that the chicken is slaughtered according to Islamic law. "My customers do not like buying already slaughtered chickens. "If I can't see the slaughtering process, then I can't be sure whether the chicken was cut in the proper way. If bismillah is not said, the chicken meat is not halal," one customer said. There are some 720 stalls in East Jakarta and 360 in Central Jakarta. Each processes between 50 and 200 birds a day. Over half a million chickens enter the city each day.
