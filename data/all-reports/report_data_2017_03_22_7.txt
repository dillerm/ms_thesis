Russia (HPAI H5N8)
Highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza has been detected at least one poultry farm in Moscow Oblast, in western Russia.  The outbreak was confirmed on 1 March; 6,000 birds died from the disease, and 250,000 will be culled.  Reports are inconclusive, but suggest that there may have been one or two additional outbreaks at other commercial poultry farms in Moscow Oblast.  It is possible that up to 4 million animals may have to be culled to contain the outbreak.  In addition, 14 farm workers have been hospitalized, reportedly with symptoms of avian influenza; however, HPAI H5N8 is not known to infect humans.
