H5N1 in Wild Birds in Japan:
An endangered mountain hawk eagle, also called the Hodgson?s hawk eagle (Spizaetus nipalensis orientalis), found near Sagaramura in Kumamoto Prefecture, has tested positive for H5N1.  The bird was found sick on January 4 and died soon afterwards.  Investigations on the pathogenicity of the virus and an analysis of  its phylogenetic origin are underway.  If confirmed to be highly pathogenic, this infection preceeded the first outbreak in poultry reported on January 13.  The eagle was found less than 75 km from three of the four 2007 outbreaks.  The mountain hawk eagle does not migrate and it is unclear at the present time how it was infected.  All wild birds tested so far in the areas surrounding the 2007 H5N1 poultry outbreaks have been negative.
