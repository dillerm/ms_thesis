H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
On March 14, the Bac Ninh provincial Peopleâ€™s Committee announced the occurrence of bird flu in Nam Son commune. 400 birds on a farm began to show signs of illness on March 10 and died on March 11. The birds had been vaccinated for four months. The veterinary agency inspected the farm and found signs of bird flu so they destroyed the remaining birds on the farm and sent samples to a central veterinary diagnostic centre, and had the area disinfected with lime and cloramin B. The Bac Ninh Animal Health Department has set up two temporary checkpoints, suspended all activities involving poultry in markets within Nam Son commune, vaccinated all the fowl in the commune, and is closely monitoring the slaughter of poultry in an effort to prevent the disease from spreading.
