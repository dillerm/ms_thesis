H7N9 in Poultry in China
Scientists at Fudan University in Shanghai claimed earlier this week that they believe the new H7N9 bird flu virus originated from poultry or wild birds in eastern China. Genetic research, analysis through bioinformatics, and gene sequencing lead them to discover “that the NA (neuraminidase) of the N9 subtype had its origins in Baikal Teal in Hongze Lake in Jiangsu Province.” Prior to this announcement, the theory was that the NA proteins from the virus came from wild birds in South Korea. To date, there have been 131 human cases of the H7N9 virus reported in China and 36 deaths.
