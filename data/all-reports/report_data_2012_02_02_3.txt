H5N1 in Poultry in Bhutan
Backyard poultry farms in the Chukha and Thimphu Districts experienced outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza on December 30 and January 13, respectively. Out of 2,280 susceptible birds on the farms, 141 birds died from the disease and an additional 1,813 were destroyed. The remaining 467 birds will be culled to prevent the spread of the virus. The birds tested positive for the H5N1 virus at the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL) in Bhopal, India, and the National Centre for Animal Health, Serbithang, Thimphu. The source of the outbreaks remains unknown but they appear to be epidemiologically linked. Control measures already applied include stamping out, quarantine, movement control inside the country, screening, disinfection of infected premises/establishment(s), and dipping/spraying.Vaccination is prohibited and there will be no treatment of affected animals.
