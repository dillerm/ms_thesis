Avian Influenza in Wild birds in Vietnam
 According to a report submitted by researchers from South Korea and Hanoi, regional trade and wild birds are responsible for the recent spread of the low pathogenic avian influenza virus to Vietnamese domestic ducks. Between November 2011 and March 2012, researchers identified a total of 196 isolated cases. A total of 57 low pathogenic avian influenza viruses were identified primarily from domestic ducks located in different regions of Vietnam. The research noted a range of various subtypes of LPAI viruses: H3 (n=16), H4 (n=4), H6 (n=24), H7 (n=1) and H9 (n=10). The research concluded that further surveillance is necessary to fully understand and properly react to these unique avian influenza viruses and their epidemiology.
