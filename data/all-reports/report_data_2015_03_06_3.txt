Taiwan (HPAI H5)
The Council of Agriculture (COA) has placed a new regulation making it mandatory for poultry to be raised in enclosed spaces, in an effort to prevent contact with wild birds and stop the spread of avian influenza.  It is estimated that 4.2 million domestic poultry have been culled on 853 farms since the current outbreaks started.  Poultry farmers will be given six months (until September) to comply with the new regulation, after which violators will be subject to fines.  This mandate is in addition to current restrictions on the movement of birds on infected farms and disinfection requirements after culling.  The COA is also considering revising the poultry farm registration system to require the registration of poultry farms that have 500 birds or more, instead of the current 3,000.
