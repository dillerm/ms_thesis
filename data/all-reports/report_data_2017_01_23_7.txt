Chile (LPAI H7)
Low-pathogenic H7 avian influenza has been detected at a turkey farm in Valparaiso, central Chile.  This is the second outbreak of this strain in the region so far in January, and the two outbreaks are linked.  According to the report, dated January 18, no turkeys died from the disease: testing was done when respiratory symptoms were observed among the birds.  35,000 turkeys will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease, and other preventative measures will be taken, including sanitary burial of culled birds and disinfection of the site.
