Lebanon (H5N1)
The Agriculture Minister of Lebanon has reported the presence of H5N1 avian influenza virus at a poultry farm in Nabishit.  All the birds at the farm will be culled to prevent further spread of the disease.  In addition to culling, an isolation zone has been set up around the farm.  The cause of this outbreak was not reported. This is the first time that HPAI H5N1 has been detected in Lebanon.
