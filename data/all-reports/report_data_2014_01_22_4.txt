Avian Influenza in Poultry in South Korea (HPAI H5N8)
The South Korean Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency confirmed nine outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N8 in the past week at poultry farms in Gochang, North Jeolla Province. In total, about 200,000 birds have been destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading. Additionally, a temporary lockdown was enforced at all poultry farms in North and South Jeolla provinces. “The provincial government is trying to find out the causes of the outbreaks, suspecting that migratory birds might have spread the virus.” This is the country’s first case of avian influenza since May 2011.
