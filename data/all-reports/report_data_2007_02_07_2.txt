H5N1 in Domestic Animals in Japan:
H5N1 was officially confirmed at the Sato Broiler Farm in  Hyuga, Miyazaki, Japan this week.  All 49,000 poultry on the farm and  50,000 on an adjacent farm have been destroyed. Hyuga is located 60 km from the  earlier outbreak in Kiyotake in Miyazaki.H5N1 was also confirmed at the Hashimoto Nojo Poultry Farm in Takahashi,  Okayama Prefecture. The farm owner is reported as being baffled as to how his  chickens were infected because all the windows  and ventilation holes in the poultry houses on the farm were equipped with  nylon sheets and wire netting to keep out wild birds.  All together there  have been three HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in Japan this year. An outbreak of unexplained  mortality in a fourth farm located in Shitomi, Muyazaki Prefecture, is being  investigated for possible bird flu.  H5 avian influenza has been detected  and further characterization is being performed.
