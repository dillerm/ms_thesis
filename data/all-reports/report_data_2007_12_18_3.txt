H5N1 in Poultry in Benin
On December 5, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reported that 33 chickens died from a flock “wandering in the village” of  Honvie in the Adjara Region on November 7. Highly pathogenic avian influenza has been detected and further characterization is in progress. In Cotonou, 67 layers have died from a flock of 308 birds. The outbreak started on December 3; the source may be due to an illegal introduction of poultry from Ghana.
