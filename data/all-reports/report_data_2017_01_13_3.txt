France (LPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports that low-pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in samples from guinea fowl at a poultry farm in the Department of Deux Sèvres, western France.  The farm also housed turkeys, ducks, and chickens; those species tested negative for the virus, but all birds at the farm were destroyed as a precautionary measure (the total population was 4,670 birds).  Control measures include a 1-km restricted zone around the outbreak, screening, disinfection/disinfestation, traceability, and stamping out.
