H5N1 in Poultry in Japan
According to a report from prefectural officials on February 14, chickens from a farm in Aichi prefecture tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The farm reported early on February 14 that about 20 chickens had died and four of the five dead chickens had tested positive for bird flu in a preliminary test.  The local government started culling all 17,500 chickens at the farm and banned transportation of around 900,000 chickens at 18 farms within a 10 km radius. An H5N1 bird flu infection case has been confirmed in more than 160 chickens recently found dead at a poultry farm in Mie Prefecture, prefectural officials reported on February 16. After genetic tests showed that the birds were infected with H5 bird flu, officials decided to cull about 67,000 chickens raised at the affected farm and prohibit the movements of chickens and eggs within a 10 km radius of the farm.
