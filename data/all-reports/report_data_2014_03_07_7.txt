Avian Influenza in Humans in China (LPAI H7N9).
The National Health and Family Planning Commission of China confirmed five new cases of H7N9 on February 23 and 24. Four of the victims, a 31-year-old man from the Guangdong province, a 76-year-old man from Guangdong province, a 75-year-old woman from Guangdong province, and a 33-year-old man from Guzngxi province, all have a history of exposure to poultry and are being treated in the hospital. The final victim, a 55-year-old woman from Guangdong province, is in critical condition and the source of her outbreak remains unknown. China has been hit especially hard with avian influenza over the past couple of months and the Chinese government continues to educate the public, increase surveillance methods, and monitor poultry that comes in and out of the country to prevent further outbreaks.
