H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 27-year-old resident of Boyolali in Central Java province died from suspected H5N1 bird flu. The patient was treated first in Pandan Arang Boyolali regional public hospital, but was transferred to Dr. Moewardi hospital as a bird flu suspect. He died from a respiratory infection during treatment. Hundreds of chickens had recently died in his area, but officials have encountered difficulty in diagnosing the disease as no dead chickens were left to sample. So far there have been no further signs of bird flu in humans, but monitoring continues.Four people from Pontianak in West Kalimantan province are being treated for suspected bird flu. The patients all developed fever and flu symptoms after chickens in their area suddenly died. They are being treated in Dr. Soedarso hospital. The four patients (two ten-year olds, a 15-year-old, and a 9-year-old) have been treated with Tamiflu and remain in isolation. Samples from the patients have been sent to the research and development laboratory of the Ministry of Health (Litbangkes) in Jakarta for bird flu confirmation. Three of the patients are from the same neighborhood, but one is from a different area of the city. A four-year-old who had been treated for suspected bird flu at the same hospital tested negative for bird flu, recovered from flu symptoms, and has been discharged.A 34-year-old woman from Jakarta died from H5N1 bird flu on June 1.
