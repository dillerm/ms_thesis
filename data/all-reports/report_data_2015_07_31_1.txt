Germany (HPAI H7N7)
According to a World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) report, an additional case of highly pathogenic H7N7 avian influenza has been reported at a poultry farm in Emsland, Lower Saxony.  50 chickens died and the remaining 10,054 were culled to prevent the disease from spreading.  In addition to culling, all farms within a 3-km radius have been placed under quarantine, and those within 10 km are under observation.  Poultry from three non-commercial flocks within a 1-km radius were also preemptively culled.  The new farm is located only 1 km from a farm where low pathogenic H7N7 was identified in June. Investigations are underway to determine the source of the virus and whether there is a connection between the two farms.
