Avian Influenza in Poultry in Macao (LPAI H7).
The Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau (IACM) and the Health Bureau (SSM) of Macao, a Special Administrative Region of the People√¢??s Republic of China, confirmed that samples of chicken imported from the mainland found at live bird markets tested positive for avian influenza. Once the H7 virus was identified at the market, all 7,500 birds were destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading. Additionally, the government has stopped the import of live poultry for 21 days. None of the 30 workers who came in contact with the contaminated poultry are showing flu-like symptoms, but will be observed for 10-days to ensure their well-being. Further characterization of the neuraminidase suptype is in progress.
