H5N1 in Wild Birds in Iran
Twenty-four saker falcons (Falco cherrug), one kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), and a number of owls have died at Tehranâ€™s Pardisan Park.  The Iranian Veterinary Organization has collected samples for testing between February 23 to March 1, and at least one bird tested positive for avian influenza.  Further testing is in progress.  It was decided on March 6 that all birds at the park will be culled, but the operation has been postponed until final test results are known.
