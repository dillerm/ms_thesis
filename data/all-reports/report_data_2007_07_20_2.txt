H5N1 in  Wild Birds in Russia
In reports from July 17, 2007, antibodies to H5 have been found in 50 
				    out of 4,000 wild bird samples taken this year from five regions in 
				    Siberia. None of the six million poultry in the high risk areas have 
				    been affected. According to the spokesman of the local veterinary 
				    authority, “the presence of antibodies meant that either the birds had 
				    survived avian influenza, or remained infected but it had not spread in 
				    an open form, and could be transmitted to other birds.” (more...)
