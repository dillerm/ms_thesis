South Korea (HPAI H5)
According to quarantine officials, a case of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza was confirmed in chicken and geese that died at a poultry farm in Busan.  Further tests are needed to determine if they died from the H5N8 strain of the disease.  580 geese, chickens, and pigeons at the farm were all culled to prevent the disease from spreading.  Four checkpoints have also been set up around the farm to disinfect cars and control the movement of people and animals.  In addition to the Busan outbreak, officials said ducks at a farm in Anseong also tested positive for the H5 strain.
