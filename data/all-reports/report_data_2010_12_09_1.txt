H5N1 in Wild birds in S. Korea
According to the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, a blood sample from a wild mallard in the Mangyeong River in North Jeolla tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The sample was taken as part of the annual preventive inspection of migratory birds and the result was confirmed on December 7. In order to keep the disease from spreading to domestic poultry, the ministry is conducting an emergency disinfection of the area around the river and has established a quarantine zone within a 10 km (6.2 mile) radius with four mobile quarantine posts within a 1-km radius of the epicenter. Since the positive test was not from a poultry farm, Korea maintains avian-influenza free status and is able to export poultry. There are 13 duck farms and roughly 3.2 million poultry being raised within the management zone. Officials are monitoring birds for sickness and installing nets around farms to keep away wild birds. These farms will not be able to ship poultry until quarantine officials have cleared them.
