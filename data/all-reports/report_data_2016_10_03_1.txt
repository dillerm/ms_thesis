Avian Influenza in Animals in Antarctica
A new strain of avian influenza (H5N5) has been discovered in Antarctic penguins. In 2015, four chinstrap penguins were found to carry the H5N5 strain. The hemagglutinin gene shared striking similarities with the North American while the neuraminidase gene shared similarities with Eurasian strains. The new strain follows the earlier detection of H11N2 strain in 2013 in Adelie penguins and was also present the following year in a snowy sheathbill suggesting that avian influenza viruses may survive under the ice during the winter and resurface in the summer when migrating penguins return to the area. The influenza has not made the penguins ill.Â  While the cause of the outbreak is unknown, the mostly likely suspects for delivering the viruses to Antarctica are Arctic tern and skua.
