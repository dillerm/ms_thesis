Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports new cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in the Federal Capital Territory, and the states of Adamawa, Ebonyi, Jigawa, Kaduna, Kano, and Plateau.  Samples were sent to the National Veterinary Research Institute, where avian influenza was confirmed.  A total of 4,708 birds died of the virus, and the remaining 41,105 were culled to prevent it spreading further.  Additional control measures include: movement control; disinfection; quarantine; surveillance; stamping out; and official destruction of animal products. The cause of these outbreaks is unknown, but poor farm biosecurity was observed.
