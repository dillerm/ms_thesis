Indonesia (HPAI H5N1)
The head of Trenggalek Animal Health Center confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 after thousands of birds were found dead in the East Java province. The 20 samples that were tested were identical to the virus that had previously killed poultry in the area. In an effort to prevent the disease from spreading further, all poultry at the affected farm will be culled. Additionally, all poultry within a 200-mile radius of the farm will be vaccinated and the premises will be disinfected.
