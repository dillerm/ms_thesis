H5N1 in Poultry in Canada
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency announced on September 27 that they had quarantined a farm in Saskatchewan where there is an outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N3 on a poultry farm. Officials are planning on euthanizing 50,000 chickens. The Minister of Agriculture and Agri-Food, Gerry Ritz, stated "The most important thing to note at this time is that the domestic poultry industry is safe and free from H5N1, which has been associated with human illness, and that this H7N3 is unlikely to cause human sickness." Japan has banned poultry imported from Canada.
