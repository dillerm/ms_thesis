China (LPAI H7N9)
According to the World Health Organization, China has reported 15 serious cases of low pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza virus in humans since December.  Three have died; the rest are in critical condition.  Their ages range from 20 to 78, with most over 50 years old, and all but one had been exposed to live poultry.  The H7N9 strain has not been shown to move easily between humans.  China has tried to reduce outbreaks by shutting down live poultry markets for cleaning.
