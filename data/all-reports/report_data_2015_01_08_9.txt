Taiwan (HPAI H5N2)
Around 120,000 chickens on a farm in Pingtung County will be culled due to the detection of HPAI H5N2 virus.  The outbreak started in December with sporadic cases and is the first time the farm has experience an avian influenza outbreak.  The Pingtung Agriculture department and the Animal Disease Control Center have banned the movement of chickens and will disinfect the farm as they continue monitoring the situation. The same virus was found in four goose farms in Yulin County with a total of 16,000 birds and on a duck egg farm in Pingtung County with 8500 ducks. The strain of HPAI H5N2 is completely new and contains a hemagglutinin gene that is related to the 2014 South Korean HPAI H5N8, but the neuraminidase gene is more rleated to a virus found in Jilin in 2011.
