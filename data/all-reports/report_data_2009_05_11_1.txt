H1N1 Summary in Canada
Some pigs on a farm in western Alberta were infected with the H1N1 flu virus. Brian Evans from the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said that the virus may have jumped from a farm worker to the animals. The worker returned from Mexico on April 12 and was experiencing flu-like symptoms, from which he has fully recovered. It has been confirmed that the swine are infected with the same H1N1 strain that is affecting humans around the world. The pigs have been placed in isolation and are now recovering. Evans says that there is no evidence that humans can get H1N1 from eating pork and urged against bans of Canadian products. The World Health Organization says that although the H1N1 virus contains swine flu genes, there is no evidence of pigs passing the disease to humans.
