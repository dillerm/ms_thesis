H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
More than 500 ducks and four chickens came down with bird flu on the Lien Hoa commune in Quang Ninh province. According to Hoang Van Nam, head of the Veterinary Department, an additional 1,300 birds were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Deputy minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Diep Kinh Tan blamed the problem on a lack of disease prevention in some localities. He directed the Veterinary Department to handle the disease in Quang Ninh thoroughly and set up a quarantine center for poultry and livestock. In addition he urged localities nationwide to vaccinate flocks of ducks since they are especially prone to bird flu.
