H5N1 in Wild birds in Kenya
Health experts are concerned that Lake Victoria may be a site for bird flu to enter the country because it attracts many migratory birds, a suspected source. Dr Kiama in Maseno said, “The recent outbreak of avian influenza in Sudan has left Kenya vulnerable to the virus due to the porous border with that country.” Ever since the virus was detected in Sudan, Kenyan health officials have been working to inform poultry farmers about bio-security, surveillance and response strategies for bird flu.
