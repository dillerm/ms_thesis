Nepal (HPAI H5N1)
Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in a zoo in the Sunsari District, southeastern Nepal.  Authorities suspected avian influenza after several birds were found dead, over the course of about a week, in a village children’s park; the virus was confirmed present on 6 March.  The park has been closed for a month as a precaution.  The species involved included a turkey, a peacock, an eagle owl, and a guinea pig; it is unclear whether the birds were free-ranging or kept in enclosures.
