Two pigs on a farm in Sicily tested positive for pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus after showing symptoms of influenza beginning December 3. One of the two pigs that had originally fallen ill was slaughtered and the remaining pigs on the farm (12) were tested for infection. Nine pigs tested positive for antibodies to the virus and all of them tested negative for the virus. All of the pigs recovered fully within a few days. The origin of the outbreak is unknown.
