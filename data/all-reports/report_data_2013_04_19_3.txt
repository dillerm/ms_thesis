H5N1 in Humans in Egypt
 The Egyptian Health Ministry confirmed earlier this week that a 26-year-old man from the Dakahlia Governorate, located just north of the city Cairo, died of the H5N1 virus, bringing the number of human cases to three, including two deaths since the start of the year. The source of the outbreak remains unknown and the ministry is urging all citizens to consult their doctors immediately if they show any flu-like symptoms.
