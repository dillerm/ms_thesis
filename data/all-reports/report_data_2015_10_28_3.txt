Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported five additional cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus on poultry farms in the state of Rivers.  A total of 710 chickens died and the remaining 8,947 were culled to prevent further spread of the virus. In addition to culling, animal products were destroyed and carcasses, by-products and waste were disposed of properly, the practices of stamping out, quarantine, movement control, and disinfection were also carried out.  The source of the outbreaks is unknown, though it was noted that the farms had poor biosecurity.
