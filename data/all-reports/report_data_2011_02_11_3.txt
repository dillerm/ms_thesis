H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
Officials in Bangladesh have culled 46,387 birds following the re-emergence of bird flu last month. Bird flu was found on 16 commercial farms in the first week of January. An official stated, "A total of 65,481 eggs were also destroyed during the same time." As a result of these outbreaks, the Fisheries and Live Stock Department has strengthened its surveillance to contain the further spread of H5N1 bird flu virus. "We've taken special steps like motivating farmers to adopt preventive measures since the disease found to reemerge last month to contain its outbreak," Director of the government's Influenza Preparedness and Response Project, Nazrul Islam, said. He added that field officials have been trained in proper culling and disposal techniques and that they have asked border authorities to be more vigilant because there have been recent reports of bird flu in neighboring countries like India and Nepal. Officials expect that the outbreak will dwindle as winter comes to an end.
