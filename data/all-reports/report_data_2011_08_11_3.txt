H5N1 in Wild birds in USA
 Due to high temperatures in July, a turkey flock in Minnesota suffered a heat-related death loss of 2,500 turkeys.  Originally thought to be associated with low pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 subtype, samples were sent to the University of Minnesota Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory. Their findings listed the birdsâ€™ deaths due to heat stress and not avian influenza.  The flock of turkeys has been retested several times throughout the month of July with all test results negative for avian influenza. The flock was depopulated on August 1, and cleaning and disinfection were scheduled for August 4.
