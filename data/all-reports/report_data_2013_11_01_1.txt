China (H7N9)
Chinese researchers recently conducted a study regarding last spring’s outbreak of H7N9 flu outbreak in southern China. According to the study, shutting down live poultry markets is 97 to 99 percent successful in preventing humans from contracting the virus. While only 135 human cases were confirmed during last spring’s outbreak, 45 of those cases resulted in fatalities. In most cases humans contracted the virus from infected birds, with only a few instances of humans passing the virus to humans. Live poultry markets are an ideal breeding ground for the virus, because of the crowded and unsanitary conditions. With the closing of the markets costing the economy an estimated $1.6 billion, other strategies of preventing outbreak besides mass extended closures are being explored. These may include instituting rest days in which the markets are closed for a day while they are disinfected, or a ban on leaving unsold poultry in markets from day to day.
