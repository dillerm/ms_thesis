Cote d'Ivoire.
Cases of the H5N1 virus (avian flu) were confirmed in the commercial capital, Abidjan, on October 15. Confirmation came from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation in Cote d'Ivoire following the return of positive test results on ravens, which were found dead in the yard of a high school on October 6. Currently, the high school is closed, and the National Institute for Public Health is monitoring 25 people who were exposed to the carcasses of the birds.
