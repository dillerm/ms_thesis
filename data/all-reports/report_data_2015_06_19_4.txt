USA (HPAI H5N2)
Two additional cases of the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus have been reported.  One occurred at a farm in Dixon County, Nebraska that was already culling its 200,000 chickens, the fourth farm in the state to be affected by bird flu.  In addition to culling, all nearby farms have been placed under quarantine to prevent the disease from spreading.  The other case occurred at a farm in Wright County, Iowa with 1 million chickens, where preliminary tests indicate the virus is present.  32 million birds have died or been culled at 76 previously affected farms in Iowa. After studying virus samples from more than 80 turkey and chicken farms, scientists from the USDA?s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) have released a preliminary epidemiological report indicating that H5N2 avian influenza has likely been spread through insufficient application of biosecurity practices.  These include: sharing of equipment between infected and non-infected farms, employees moving between infected and non-infected farms, lack of cleaning and disinfection of vehicles moving between farms, and rodent or small wild birds inside the poultry houses.  In addition, air samples collected outside affected poultry houses were found to contain virus particles and wind data shows a relationship between high winds and an increase in the number of infected farms, indications that the virus may be transmitted by air.  More than 49 million birds have died or been culled in 15 states this spring due to the disease.
