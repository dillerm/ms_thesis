South Korea (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported two more cases of the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus on commercial duck farms in the Jeollanam-do Province.  No deaths were reported, but as a precaution against further spread of the disease 14,300 ducks were culled.  In addition to culling, the practices of movement control, disinfection, quarantine, stamping out, zoning and controlling wildlife reservoirs were put into place.  The source of the outbreak is unknown. KBS World Radio has reported that ducks at a market in South Jeolla province tested positive for H5N8. To prevent further spread of the virus, markets have been fumigated, the sale of ducks and Korea's native chicken has been curtailed, and events that include a large concentration of birds have been prohibited.  Districts in the North Chungcheong Province are taking measures to protect their poultry farms from the disease by disinfecting farms, inspecting nets designed to keep out wild birds and increasing quarantine measures. In the last year the Eumseong District has culled over 1.5 million birds.  There are currently 990,000 ducks and 4.6 million chickens on 157 farms in the district.
