H5N1 in Poultry in Cambodia
Highly pathogenic H5N1 broke out in a village in Prey Veng province on April 22. The village was home to 1167 chickens and ducks; 903 died and the rest were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Samples tested by the National Veterinary Research Institute and Pasteur Institute of Cambodia were positive for H5N1. The National Veterinary Research Institute (NaVRI) of the Department of Animal Health and Production conducted an investigation in the village from 20 to 23 April 2010, but the results were inconclusive. Officials have implemented measures to control the disease, including movement control inside the country and disinfection of the infected premises.
