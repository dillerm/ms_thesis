Avian Influenza in Humans in Cambodia (HPAI H5N1)
Cambodian health officials confirmed last week that a two-year-old girl from Kampot province died on March 14 after contracting H5N1. This is the country’s fourth bird flu death this year. About 90% of the chickens in the young girl’s village died this past month of bird flu, and officials believe that the young girl had direct contact with dead chickens before becoming sick. Officials are urging parents and guardians to keep their children away from dead or sick poultry, as they are highly susceptible to the disease.
