H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
As of May 31, H5N1 bird flu had been discovered on 21 of 85 major poultry farms in Bangladesh this year and over 46,000 chicks had been culled. In response, an eight-member committee of experts was formed on June 5 by the National Advisory Committee to plan a vaccination program. The new committee has three days to submit its recommendation. The 22-member National Advisory Committee was formed last year to prevent and eliminate bird flu in Bangladesh.
