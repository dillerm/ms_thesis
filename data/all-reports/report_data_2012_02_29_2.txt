H5N1 in Wild birds in Nepal
After the Department of Livestock Services, a part of the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives, had denied that crows at Rastriya Shava Grihya died due to bird flu, the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives confirmed on February 16 that bird flu was the cause of death for crows in Kathmandu valley. The Parliamentary Committee on Natural Resources and Means directed the ministry to take necessary steps to control bird flu as soon as it is recorded in the community, increase the budget to control the spread of bird flu, establish a mobile team for monitoring and surveillance at the affected areas, be extra vigilant in border areas, and improve its quarantine services. The committee asked the ministry to explain why it had not reported the disease to the public as soon as it was confirmed and why they had begun to take action to control the disease without declaring an outbreak. There were also complaints that the ministry had not kept up surveillance in a previous crisis zone for the required 90 days and that farmers had not been properly compensated for poultry that were culled.
