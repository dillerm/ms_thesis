H5N1 in Poultry in United Kingdom
A farmer in Suffolk has been charged with violation of quarantine regulations during a November 2007 outbreak of bird flu. The man illegally moved suspected bird carcasses between farms, breaking quarantine regulations and possibly endangering more birds or people in the process. The 2007 outbreak involved 5,000 turkeys that tested positive for H5N1 and were culled. Britain is taking a very serious approach to the bird flu risk nationwide. The House of Lords has previously released statements warning that pandemic flu is imminent, and this week a Cabinet office released a statement stating that pandemic flu poses a more serious risk than terrorism.
