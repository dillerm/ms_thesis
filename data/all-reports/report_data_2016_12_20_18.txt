Macao SAR (LPAI H7N9)
On December 14, the Macao SAR Government Health Bureau reported a human case of highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 in a 58-year-old poultry trader at a wholesale market stall selling silky fowl, where specimens tested positive for the virus. The patient was hospitalized and placed in isolation but is not showing symptoms of the virus. The traderâ€™s wife is also under quarantine but she has tested negative for the virus. Officials shut down the market and destroyed over 10,000 live birds. Other control measures include review of 3 additional markets and cleaning and disinfection work. Officials are also monitoring a van driver who had contact with the infected birds.
