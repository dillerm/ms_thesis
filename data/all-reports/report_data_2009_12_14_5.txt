An outbreak of pandemic H1N1 (2009) that began on March 30 and ended on April 1 was recently reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE). Two pigs from a herd of 360 came down with the disease from an unknown source. Tests to confirm the presence of the virus were run by the Mexico-United States Commission for the Prevention of Foot and Mouth Disease and Other Exotic Diseases of Animals. One of the pigs was slaughtered and the other responded well to treatment with enrofloxacin and gentamicin. Further measures, such as movement control of animals, screening, and zoning have been taken to prevent the spread of the disease.
