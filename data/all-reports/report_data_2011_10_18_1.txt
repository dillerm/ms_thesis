H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
 In the week following the announcement of two human cases in Bali, two sub-districts reported bird flu outbreaks in poultry in the adjacent island of Lombok. In one village more than 350 chickens had died and the livestock agency was contacted.  Some villagers reported killing and eating birds that had become ill, while chickens already found dead were buried.  The Animal Diseases Eradication Team sprayed disinfectant, took blood samples and quarantined the infected areas.  Health Minister Endang Rahayu Sedyaningsih encouraged people to stay away from birds, wash hands if they came into contact with birds, and warn children not to touch dead birds.
