Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
According to a World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) report, 30 new outbreaks of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus have been reported at chicken farms and backyard flocks in the Plateau Region.  Only one case affected broilers, with the rest being laying hens.  In total, 1,409 birds died and the remaining 60,711 were culled to prevent further spread of the disease.  In addition to culling, quarantine, movement controls, and disinfection measures have been implemented.  The source of the outbreak is unknown, but OIE has noted poor biosecurity measures at the affected premises.
