France (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 in Marck, in the Pas-de-Calais department of northern France. This is the first record of this strain in France.  On November 17, 25 wild ducks (gadwalls, Anas strepera and Eusasian widgeons, Anas penelope) were found dead: they were part of a flock of 75 which was kept on a private body of water and used as call-ducks by hunters.  On November 26, H5N8 was confirmed in samples taken from the dead ducks.  A group of 35 ducks remained on the body of water after the mortality event; they were slaughtered on November 28.  The outbreak was caused by contact with wild species, and control measures include screening, disinfection/disinfestation, stamping out, and official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste.  Vaccination is prohibited and affected animals are not being treated.  Testing was conducted by the ANSES Reference National Laboratory in Maisons-Alfort.
