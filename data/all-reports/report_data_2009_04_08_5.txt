H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
Blood samples taken from the two-year-old, Wahyu Ibnu Saputra, who died last week at Pekanbaru, confirm bird flu as the cause of death. Officials are urging his relatives to visit the local health clinic for a check-up although there has never been a case of human-to-human infection with bird flu. The Pekanbaru Livestock Husbandry Office decided to cull chickens in the surrounding area to curb the spread of the virus.
