H5N1 in Wild birds in Australia
Scientists at Deakin University are studying avian malaria to help predict the future spread of bird flu in Australia.  The research, headed by Deakin's environmental scientist Rohan Clark, will focus on the Torres Strait region where migratory birds commonly move from south-east Asia and Papua-New Guinea to Australia. Studying the rate at which avian malaria spreads within populations may provide insight into how other diseases, such as H5N1, are spread through migratory birds.
