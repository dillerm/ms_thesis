Nepal (H5N1)
The Bhaktapur District Livestock Office confirmed five new cases of H5N1 earlier this week, raising the total number of outbreaks to 36 in the past four weeks. A rapid response team culled 3,905 chickens and destroyed 1,566 eggs and 100 kg of chicken feed at the infected farms. Officials remain on high alert and continue to test farms throughout the area in hopes to prevent the disease from spreading to more farms in the district.
