India (HPAI? H5N1)
Officials at the National Zoological Park in Delhi reported an outbreak of possible highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus among the zoo’s waterbirds.  A total of nine birds have died including ducks, painted storks, and pelicans. The details are poorly reported but two unspecified birds died on 10/14, 6 on 10/15 and a “waterbird” died on 10/17. From the samples tested, two birds (also unspecified) have tested positive for H5.  The zoo has been closed until further notice as of 10/18. A day after the closing, three additional birds, two pelicans and a “wild hen” were found dead at the zoo.  The new carcasses have been sent for post mortem examination and laboratory testing. The source of this outbreak is unknown. Prior to the closing, the zoo had 20 ducks and 40 pelicans. The same zoo was cloed in May when 46 spotted deer died of rabies. Two birds were found dead at Hauz Khas Deer Park in Delhi on 10/21. No laboratory results are available at the present time, but the park was also closed as a precaution. This is the second site in the capital to be shut. As many as 18 other wild birds have been found dead in locations around Delhi. Fifteen painted storks have died at Gwalior Zoo in Madhya Pradesh; 3 crows died in Sundar Nagar near the zoo and one bird was found dead in Tughlakabad in south Delhi. These carcasses and additional wild bird and poultry samples have been collected and submitted for testing.
