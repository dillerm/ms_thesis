USA (H3N8)
H3N8 canine influenza has been confirmed in 4 cases in Greene county, Tennessee. The illness in three dogs is believed to have originated at a dog show in Perry, Georgia. Cases have been detected in a total of eight (FL, GA, IL, KY, SC, NC, TN and TX) states so far in the current outbreak. Canine influenza is spread through nasal or lung secretions typically via sneezing or coughing. Canine influenza is not known to cause illness in humans. The Tennessee state veterinarian suggests making sure your dog is up-to-date on vaccinations, washing your hands after contact with any dogs, avoiding co-mingling dogs, not sharing equipment or toys between dogs, and immediately isolating any dog that shows signs of illness and contacting your veterinarian.
