H5N1 in poultry in Japan
On March 14, prefectural government authorities said that H5N1 bird flu infection was confirmed among chickens at a poultry farm in Chiba city, marking the first such case in the region.  A total of four birds were found dead at the Chiba farm on March 11 and 12, and a genetic test confirmed that four of seven birds checked were infected by the highly pathogenic strain of the virus.  On March 13, local authorities culled about 35,000 birds at the farm and restricted the movements of another 869,000 birds being raised within a 10-kilometer radius of the affected farm.  ''This is a very severe situation as damage from the huge earthquake is also serious,'' said Chiba Governor Kensaku Morita at a press conference, referring to the earthquake that recently struck northeastern and eastern Japan.OIE recently reported 119 new cases of H5N1 bird flu in Japan in three separate outbreaks between March 10 and March 17 (out of 373,000 total susceptible birds): 30 birds from a poultry farm in Miyazaki that tested positive for the virus on March 5; 67 birds from a poultry farm in Nara that tested positive for the virus on February 28; and 22 birds from a poultry farm in Mie that tested positive for the virus on February 26. All cases of bird flu were confirmed by rapid testing.  Since the confirmations of the infections, mandatory movement restriction has been enforced within 10 km of each affected farm; in addition, all poultry at each of the farms were destroyed.
