H1N1 Update
Bird flu is highly pathogenic, killing roughly 60% of people who are infected, but does not spread easily from human to human; while the 2009 H1N1 (sometimes called the swine flu) virus causes primarily mild clinical symptoms, but spreads easily between humans. Scientists are worried that the new swine flu, with its ability to pick up genetic information, will combine with the bird flu virus to create a strain that is both highly contagious and lethal to people. Scientists are keeping a close watch on bird flu and are especially concerned about what will happen when the H1N1 virus reaches countries such as China, Egypt and Indonesia, the epicenters of bird flu. Although scientists are discussing the scenario, there is as yet no evidence that it will happen. Leading virologist, Dr. Robert Webster, says that there is talk of experimentally combining the virus strains in a lab so that scientists can study the effects of such a chimera. Some have criticized the warnings of pandemic as overblown, but Webster cautions that the disease is still in its infancy and it is important to be prepared in case it grows into something worse.
