H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
A five-year-old girl from Phnom Penh’s Preak Leap village in Russei Keo district has died of respiratory complications after contracting H5N1 bird flu, according to a joint statement from the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organisation on February 7. According to her family, the girl fell sick on January 29 and died February 3, in what is the first recorded case of bird flu in humans in Cambodia this year. 200 chickens has died and 700 more were sick in the village, including at least 20 that died in the girl’s house. Philippe Buchy, head of the virology unit at Phnom Penh’s Pasteur Institute, confirmed the case of bird flu, adding that the institute was conducting further tests. “We are always concerned if the viruses have a higher capacity to mutate or to become [drug] resistant, so we are testing this virus,” he said. The girl contracted the disease by eating meat from an infected chicken. Her father does not believe that she died of bird flu. Nima Asgari, a public health specialist at the WHO, said the organization has been trying to increase public awareness about bird flu. “It is very difficult to change behaviour,” he said, “the population as a whole knows about the virus, they just don’t act on it. Translating that awareness into action is where we need to do more work.”
