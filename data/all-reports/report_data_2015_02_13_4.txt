China (HPAI H5N6)
According to the Yunnan Department of Health, the first case of fowl-to-human transmission of avian influenza was detected in a 44-year-old man from Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture.  The man was admitted to a local clinic with fever and chills, and died three days later from pneumonia complications.  Blood tests revealed that the man had contracted the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus, most likely through contact with wild ducks.  There has been no evidence of person to person transmission.  This is only the third known instance of bird-to-human transmission of the H5N6 virus and the second fatal case.
