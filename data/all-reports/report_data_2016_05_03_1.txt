Lebanon (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has reported a case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus at a farm in Al Biqa' province.  The National Reference Laboratory identified the disease after abnormal deaths were reported among birds at the farm.  The 20,000 birds on the farm and another 60,000 were culled to prevent the disease spreading further.  Additional control measures include: disinfection; traceability; dipping/spraying; quarantine; stamping out; surveillance; zoning; and official destruction of animal products, carcasses, by-products, and waste.  The source of this outbreak has been traced to the illegal movement of animals. This is the first time that HPAI H5N1 has been detected in Lebanon.
