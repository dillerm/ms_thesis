China (LPAI H7N9)
Chinese health authorities are also reacting to the spreading presence of H7N9, most notably in Zhejiang, where 53 cases with 12 total fatalities have been reported and a possible case of human-to-human transmission. Health authorities in Zhejiang Province are currently investigating the source of infection in a specific family located in Hangzhou. A 49-old-male tested positive for the virus on January 20 and died a couple of days later. Additionally, the man’s 23-year-old daughter tested positive three days later, as well as his wife on January 27. The way in which the virus was spread among the family is still under investigation, but the timing of the cases may indicate that person-to-person transmission may have occurred. Of China’s cases so far this year, some 70 percent had been in contact with live poultry. In reaction, Zhejiang has banned the live poultry trade in areas where infected patients have been found.
