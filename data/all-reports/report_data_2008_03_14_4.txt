H5N1 in Poultry in India
Poultry samples from Jiaganj and Raghunathganj in West Bengal have tested positive for H5N1 accoring to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal, India. The latest outbreaks occurred on March 6. In Nayamukundapur, 600 chickens died while 300 died in Bothra.  Both villages are about 300 km from the capital Calcutta. Animal Husbandry secretary Pradeep Kumar said “Since the earlier outbreak in West Bengal occurred in backyard poultry, culling teams reported that villagers were hiding birds in infected districts. The virus may have survived because of this. Fresh culling operations will start from Sunday [Mar. 6].” Smuggled poultry from neighboring Bangladesh or birds that were hidden by villagers from the earlier culling operation are suspected to be the cause of the new outbreak. Some 50,000 birds will be culled in a new three day effort to stop the outbreak. Night raids have been conducted to catch unwilling villagers who are hiding their ducks and chickens.
