H5N1 in Poultry in Myanmar
More chickens on a farm in Sagaing division are have died from H5N1 bird flu. The sudden deaths of chickens in other parts of the division were caused by H5N1, which was verified  by laboratory testing. The findings have been reported to the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Animal Health Organization. The authorities have culled chickens and destroyed eggs on the farm to prevent the spread of the disease. This is the third case of H5N1 bird flu in Myanmar since February. People have been urged to step up bio-security measures by changing their livestock breeding systems; avoiding illegal import, transport and trading of chickens and their products; and promptly reporting suspected bird flu cases.
