H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
H5N1 has spread to another two districts in Bangladesh. Workers culled over 1,100 birds at two commercial farms in the Meherpur district following confirmation of the virus, livestock officials said. The government recently increased compensation for culled poultry to encourage farmers to report outbreaks ; butefforts to contain the virus, which has now affected 42 of the countryâ€™s 64 districts, have been hampered by the lack of public awareness. Some 25,000 birds will be culled in the southeastern district of Comilia; over 600,000 birds have been culled in Bangladesh since the current outbreak began in March of 2007.
