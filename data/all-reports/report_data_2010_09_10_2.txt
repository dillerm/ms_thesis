A farmer in Tai-Tung prefecture reported signs of parakeratosis (scaly skin) in his pigs to the prefecture animal disease control competent authority on September 2. Samples were collected and sent to the Animal Health Research Institute for diagnosis. Testing revealed the pigs were infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Only 4 cases were confirmed in a herd of 4,000 pigs. Prevention methods such as movement control and disinfection of the premises were implemented. Follow-up tests on September 6 returned negative results.
