H5N1 in Poultry in Hong Kong
A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) said on February 7 that a duck carcass found on a beach on February 3 in Tai O was confirmed to be H5N1 positive after laboratory testing. There were no poultry farms within a 3km radius of where the carcass was found and AFCD investigations have not found any backyard poultry in the area. They will continue to monitor the situation and conduct inspections of the area. All relevant government departments will continue to remain highly vigilant and strictly enforce preventive measures against avian influenza. AFCD has phoned poultry farmers to remind them to strengthen precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza and sent letters to farmers, pet bird shop owners, licence holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons reminding them that proper precautions must be taken. They also plan to conduct frequent inspections of poultry farms and the wholesale market and continue surveillance of wild birds. "People should avoid personal contact with wild birds and live poultry and their droppings. They should clean their hands thoroughly after coming into contact with them,‚Äù the spokesman said.
