H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
 An outbreak of bird flu was reported in the Rajbari District of Pakistan November 14.  After several poultry deaths, the farm owner, Dipak Kumar Kundu, notified the district livestock officer who prescribed medical treatment.  As poultry continued to die despite the medication, the farmer sent chickens to a laboratory in Dhaka for testing, who confirmed the deaths were due to bird flu.  At least 11,230 birds and 43,000 eggs were culled to prohibit the spread of the disease.
