USA (HPAI H5N2)
Three young Canada geese collected in Sterling Heights, Michigan have been confirmed to be infected with the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus.  This is the first time the disease has been discovered in the state, bringing the number of states affected with the disease to 21.  Officials are focusing on measures to prevent the disease from spreading to poultry, such as practicing biosecurity measure including washing boots and tires, gating in poultry farms, and adding air vents to barns in case the virus is airborne.
