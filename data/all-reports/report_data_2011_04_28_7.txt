H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
 The health ministry and the World Health Organisation said in a joint statement on April 21 that a five-year-old Cambodian girl, from southeastern Prey Veng province, who died on April 16 had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The girl is the fifth person to die from bird flu in the country this year.  "Compared to last year, we have seen more H5N1 cases this year and children appear to be most vulnerable. I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry," said Cambodian Health Minister Mam Bun Heng.  All five of Cambodia's bird flu cases since January, four of which were children, have been fatal.
