H5N1 in Wild birds in Thailand
Livestock officials in the northern province of Phitsanulok are disinfecting areas where migratory birds congregate as a precaution against bird flu. Two districts, Bang Krathum and Phrom Phiram, had H5N1 outbreaks in 2007, and while there were no bird flu reports in 2008, there were reports of mass poultry deaths. In addition to the disinfection, the provincial Livestock authorities will be conducting a survey for bird flu in the area.
