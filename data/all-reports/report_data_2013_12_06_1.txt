Germany (LPAI H5N3)
, Netherlands (LPAI H5N3), Portugal (LPAI H7).  Health officials in Germany, Portugal, and the Netherlands have each reported confirmed outbreaks of low pathogenic avian influenza during routine surveillance on poultry farms this week.  All 9,392 affected birds have been destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading further.   The source of the outbreaks remains unknown in all three cases and control measures being applied include movement control, screening and zoning, and disinfection of the contaminated areas.  Scientists believe that “the flocks certainly have no connection with each other but the fact that they are small and/or mixed flocks suggests the most likely source of infection is wild birds while the poultry were on free range.”
