France (HPAI H5N1)
The Agriculture Minister of France has reported an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus in backyard flock of 30 chickens.  Twenty-two broilers and layers died and the rest of the flock has been destroyed.  Preliminary sequence analysis suggests that the virus began as a low pathogenic form that has been previously found in Europe. The outbreak is the first reported in France since 2007.  To prevent the virus from spreading, France has activated the national intervention emergency plan, which includes such measures as the creation of a monitoring zone around the outbreak location.  The ministry is reassuring citizens that avian influenza cannot be transmitted through meat, eggs and fois gras or the consumption of any food.
