The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) confirmed an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 in Niamey reported in February. The 86,000 ISA Brown layers affected were destroyed. Control measures implemented include disinfection, quarantine, and surveillance. Further measures to be implemented are movement control within the country, dipping/spraying, and official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste. The source of the outbreak is unknown, but neighboring Cameroon had also reported the detection of HPAI H5N1 last week.
