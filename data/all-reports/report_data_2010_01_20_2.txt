H5N1 in Poultry in India
The Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal has confirmed H5N1 bird flu as the cause of death for two hens in Murshidabad district. The district administration began a culling operation on January 14 to prevent the spread of the disease. The culling will take place within a 3-kilometer radius of the villages where the hens died and farmers will be compensated for culled birds. There are also twenty teams working on disinfection in ten villages. As a further precaution, the movement of poultry products in the area has been restricted. Between January 5 and January 15, over 1,000 hens and ducks died mysteriously in various villages in Murshidabad. Officials initially thought that the birds had died of cold and Ranikhet disease, but as the number of dying birds increased, they became concerned and decided to test for bird flu.
