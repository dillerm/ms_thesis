Avian Influenza in Poultry in Vietnam (HPAI H5N1).
Vietnamese health officials reported on February 26 that chickens have been infected with H5N1 in 21 different municipalities and provinces throughout Vietnam leading to the destruction of about 64,000 chickens. “Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reports the outbreak was attributed to the complicated weather in the first two months of the year, and the increase in shipping and trading of poultry during the recently-ended Lunar New Year (Tet) festival.” To prevent further outbreaks, border control checks will intensify and monitored closely in hopes to catch any infected birds before entering or leaving country.
