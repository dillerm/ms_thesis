China (H9N2 and the evolution of H7N9)
A study led by scientists at St. Jude Children?s Research Hospital and the China Agricultral University has shown how the avian influenza H7N9, which has sickened more than 375 people since 2013, was created.  Researchers used genome sequencing to track changes in the H9N2 chicken virus between 1994 and 2013.  From 2010 to 2013 the H9N2 virus emerged as the predominant subtype due to its genetic makeup that allowed it to flourish despite vaccinations.  The study suggests that the H9N2 virus in infected chickens likely swapped genes with other avian influenza viruses from migratory birds and domestic ducks.  The resulting H7N9 virus included six genes from H9N2.  This tendency to swap genes also helped the H9N2 virus spread, as it allowed the virus to escape vaccine detection. The results underscore the need for continued surveillance of flu viruses on poultry farms and identified changes in the H9N2 virus that could serve as an early warning sign of emerging flu viruses.
