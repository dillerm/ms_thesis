China (LPAI H7N9)
Eleven individuals in western Chinese provinces have been diagnosed with the low pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza, including five deaths. Most of the patients were confirmed to have had contact with live poultry at the time of their infection.  All patients are adults and most were infected in late November or early December. A six year old girl in Shenzhen City in Guangdong Province tested positive for H7N9 avian influenza.  She is hospitalized and her case is described as ?mild.? Two separate cases were confirmed in a 56 year old man and a 68 year old woman in Guangdong Province.  Health officials have confirmed they are infected with H7N9; the infections appear to be related to recent outbreaks of H7N9 in poultry around Guangdong Province late last year. Authorities in Guangdong and Hong Kong culled thousands of chickens in January after exports to Hong Kong were found to be infected with the virus.
