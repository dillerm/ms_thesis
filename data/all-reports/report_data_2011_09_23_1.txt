H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
 University of Hong Kong microbiologist Malik Peiris states that wild birds are responsible for spreading the mutant strain of H5N1 bird flu.  Peiris says this is the second time wild birds have introduced the virus to poultry in China, as the first outbreak of bird flu was in the Qinghai Lake area in 2005.  In response, Hong Kong Bird Watching Society director Mike Kilburn, claims that while it is reasonable to monitor wild birds for the virus, wild birds are not responsible for transmitting the virus to humans.  Kilburn believes that the closure of Mai Po Nature Reserve when dead birds were found perpetuates the belief that wild birds cause human infection of the bird flu virus.  He goes on to state that none of the 30,000 wild birds who visit the reserve have ever tested positive for H5N1 bird flu despite extensive monitoring.
