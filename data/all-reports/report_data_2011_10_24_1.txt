H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
 Highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreaks occurred in three separate villages (Penujak , Peringgarata and Semayan) on Lombok Island in Indonesia.  At least 1,900 dead chickens were reported during the outbreaks and samples were sent to laboratories in Mataram and Bali. The Livestock and Animal Health Service confirmed the birds were infected with H5N1 bird flu. The Livestock and Animal Health Service is concerned that unofficial ports on Lombok are importing animals without quarantine inspection, causing the bird flu virus to spread.  However, the exact source of the three outbreaks on Lombok remains unknown.
