H5N1 in Poultry in Czech Republic
H5N1 has been detected on farms in two villages,  Netrebice and Kosorin in East Bohemia, where 17,000 and 54,000 birds are  contained, respectively. Both are within the 3 km exclusion zone around Norin,  where H5N1 was detected in late June. Poultry on three other farms will be  culled even though the birds did not exhibit clinical symptoms and no virus has  been detected. Josef Duben, a spokesman for the State Veterinary  Administration, said that the authorities suspect the virus has spread from  farm to farm in the local area because of the movement of people and equipment.
