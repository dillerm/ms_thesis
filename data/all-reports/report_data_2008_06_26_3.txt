H5N1 in Poultry in Pakistan
Avian influenza H5N1 has been found at a commercial poultry farm in the North West Frontier Province, 60 km northwest of the capital, Islamabad.  The owner of the farm, in Tordher village, notified authorities when 4,000 birds died over several days, and a government laboratory has confirmed the cause as bird flu.  The farmâ€™s remaining 2,000 birds were then culled and workers were examined for symptoms, though none appear to have the virus.  Farms within 3 km of the infected farm have been placed under surveillance, and their employees will be watched for symptoms.  The identification of H5N1 by the Pakistani government labs is being contested by the Swabi Poultry Association that has conducted private tests identifying the strain as H5N9.  H5N1 was first found in Pakistan in 2006, in the same province where the current outbreak is located.
