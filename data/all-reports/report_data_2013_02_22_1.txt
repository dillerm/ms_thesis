H5N1 in Poultry in Mexico
Officials from Servicio Nacional de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria (SENASICA) reported earlier this week that more than one million chickens in the north-central state of Guanajuato were exposed to the deadly bird flu virus. Health authorities have established a quarantine around the 12 affected farms and are vaccinating poultry throughout the state to help prevent further outbreaks. Additionally, the affected farms are being cleaned and disinfected and around 900,000 chickens may be culled in an effort to contain the virus and prevent the disease from spreading further.
