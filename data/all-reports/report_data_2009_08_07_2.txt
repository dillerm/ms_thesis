H5N1 in Poultry in USA
On August 5 the Minnesota Board of Animal Health quarantined a commercial turkey flock in Meeker County after avian influenza H7N9 virus was discovered during routine testing. Dale Lauer, the assistant director and a veterinarian, stressed that the flu strain was different from the more lethal H5N1 strain circulating mostly in Asia. The quarantined flock is not showing signs of illness, but officials are concerned that without precautions the virus could evolve into a strain that would be lethal to the stateâ€™s many poultry flocks. The infected flock and those within a 3-mile radius have been placed under quarantine for six weeks and will be tested repeatedly for the virus. The Minnesota Health Department is monitoring 20 poultry workers from the farm, but so far none of them have shown any symptoms.
