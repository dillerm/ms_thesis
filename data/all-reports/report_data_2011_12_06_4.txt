H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
Only a few months after the government declared Nepal a bird flu-free country, cases of bird flu have been reported in Bhaktapur near the capital Kathmandu. More than 500 chickens have been culled in the area according to the chief of the District Livestock Service Office Bhaktapur, Shiva Bahadur KC. Local people informed the Livestock Office after a number of chickens and ducks had died. After preliminary tests in the Central Veterinary Disease Control Laboratory in Nepal, samples were sent to the UK for final confirmation. Bhaktapur is one of the main poultry production areas in Nepal and the local public has raised health concerns leading to the temporary closing of 22 private schools.
