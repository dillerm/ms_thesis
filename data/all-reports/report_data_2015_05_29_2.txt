Ghana (HPAI H5N1)
The highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has been confirmed at two poultry farms, including one in the capital, Accra.  According to a health ministry official, at least 20,000 chickens on five farms around Accra and the port town of Tema have been destroyed, though the report is not clear if the disease has been confirmed in all of the locations.  A national technical committee has been created to stem the outbreak and trace its source.
