LPAI H7 in Poultry in The Netherlands
 The Dutch Economic Affairs Ministry confirmed an outbreak of LPAI H7N1 on a farm in Leusden, in the Province of Utrecht, earlier this week.  To prevent the disease from spreading further, all 11,000 free-range chickens at the infected farm will be culled.  Additionally, nearby farms are being tested for the virus and a ban on the transport of poultry, eggs, and other farm products has been initiated.
