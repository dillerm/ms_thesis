France (LPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports two new outbreaks of low-pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza.  The outbreaks took place on December 13 and 15 in the Hautes-Pyrénées department in southwestern France. Both outbreaks involved unspecified birds on farms, and all susceptible birds were destroyed by December 20.  Control measures include screening, disinfection/disinfestation, traceability, and stamping out.  The outbreak is epidemiologically linked to an earlier outbreak in Eugénie-les-Bains, in the nearby department of Landes.
