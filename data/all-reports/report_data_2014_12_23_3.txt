USA (HPAI H5N8)
The H5N8 avian influenza virus was confirmed by USDA in guinea fowl and chickens from a small backyard poultry flock in Winston, Oregon. The flock of approximately 100 birds has access to the outdoors and a pond and marsh on the premises are frequented by migratory birds. This H5N8 virus is the same virus that was found in a Washington gyrfalcon recently. Backyard flock owners can report sick birds to the State Veterinarian's office at 1-800-347-7028 or can call USDA at 1-866-536-7593. Oregon's commercial poultry industry has a robust avian influenza testing program and ODA conducts weekly surveillance testing and health inspections at the state's only live bird market in Woodburn. In addition, wild bird mortality surveillance is routinely conducted by the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife. Wild bird deaths can be reported to the ODFW toll-free line at 1-866-968-2600.
