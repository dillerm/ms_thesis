Taiwan (LPAI H6N1)
A report published this week by researchers in Taiwan urges the public to be cautious and prepared for the possibility of increasingly dangerous strains of a flu virus previously only found in chickens. The low virulent H6N1 strain was discovered in May in a 20-year-old Taiwanese woman. It is still unclear how the patient contracted the virus as she has no contact with poultry. She remains the only known case of H6N1 infection in people. The report investigates the possibility of the flu viruses combining to develop into more dangerous, thus more difficult to treat, flu strains. Scientists are calling for vigilance, and the continued development of flu vaccines.
