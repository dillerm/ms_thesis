Romania (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports 10 new outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza among wild birds in Romania.  The outbreaks were concentrated in the eastern half of the country, and all occurred on 27 January.  In total, 23 whooper swans, 5 common teals, and 1 great black-backed gull were found dead.  This set of outbreaks occurred on the same day and in the same region as a set of outbreaks among backyard poultry (see next section).  Control measures include movement control inside the country, screening, disinfection/disinfestation, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping out, control of wildlife reservoirs, and zoning.  Vaccination is prohibited and affected animals were not treated.
