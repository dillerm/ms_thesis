France (LPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports an outbreak of low-pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in Pallanne, Gers Department, in southern France.  This outbreak was detected during surveillance of a protection zone established after an earlier H5N8 outbreak: H5N1 was found on a duck farm, and 1,000 ducks were destroyed as a precaution.  This is the first detection of the low pathogenic H5N1 strain this season in France. A 1km regulated zone was established around the outbreak; other control measures include screening, disinfection/disinfestation, traceability, and stamping out.  Vaccination is permitted (if a vaccine exists), and there has been no treatment of affected animals.
