H5N1 in Wild birds in India
Because of detection of H5N1 in three villages in Bishalgarh subdivision, poultry farms in the area are demanding that the captive birds in the nearby Sipahijala wildlife sanctuary be culled. An official from Bishalgarh said that farmers “argued that if their apparently healthy and unaffected birds were to be culled merely on the basis of suspicion, the birds within the sanctuary should also be subjected to culling.”  The zoo, which is inside of the sancturary, was promptly closed to visitors. The director of the zoo said “We have 21 species of captive birds, some of which are exceedingly valuable and are very well looked after with medicine and food. It is well known that poultry chickens are the most vulnerable to the bird flu virus, besides ducks and pigeons, but we do not have them within our sanctuary.” Ashudeb Das, the sub-divisional officer for Bishalgarh noted that the culling teams are having a tough time convincing villagers, who are complaining about low compensation.
