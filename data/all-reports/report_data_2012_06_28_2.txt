Mexico (HPAI H7N3)
Mexican veterinary authorities are intensifying control measures for bird flu in a region that houses several large commercial farms after tests revealed that more than 200,000 birds in the area have died from highly pathogenic H7N3 bird flu. These are the first highly pathogenic bird flu outbreaks in Mexico since outbreaks of H5N2 in the mid 1990s. A report submitted to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) stated that intravenous pathogenicity tests revealed a highly pathogenic subtype of H7N3. The outbreaks began on June 13 at three commercial farms in Jalisco state, causing flu symptoms in the chickens. Of 1 million susceptible birds, 587,160 became ill and 211,424 died. About 60,000 have been culled so far to prevent the spread of the virus. Authorities are sampling birds at around 60 nearby farms, testing backyard poultry and poultry markets, instating quarantine measures in the region, limiting poultry movements near the outbreak, and conducting an epidemiologic investigation to determine the source of the virus. David A. Halvorson, DVM, an avian health expert at the University of Minnesota in St. Paul, said that U.S. poultry producers are always cautious about the potential for disease introduction from indirect contact with Mexican poultry. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), poultry imported from all countries except Canada must be quarantined for at least 30 days at a USDA Animal Import Center and be accompanied by import permits and veterinary health certificates. In 2004, highly pathogenic H7N3 outbreaks in British Columbia's Fraser Valley led to the culling of 19 million birds, and two related human infections were confirmed. The patients, both men who had been exposed to infected poultry on the farms, were the first known H7N3 infections in humans. Both had conjunctivitis with mild flulike symptoms.
