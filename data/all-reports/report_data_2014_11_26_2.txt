Avian Influenza in Poultry in India (HPAI H5N1)
According to the Kerala Animal Husbandry Department, the death of around 10,000 ducks in the Kuttanad area of Allapuzha and Kottayam districts was due to avian influenza. The strain was confirmed Monday by the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal to be the H5 subtype and several news outlets now say it is HPAI H5N1. The Animal Husbandry Department plants to kill all birds in the four affected villages to prevent the disease from spreading. As a further precaution, Health minister V.S. Sivakumar said vaccines will be distributed free of cost to those in affected areas. HPAI H5N1 was first reported in India in 2006 and the most recent outbreak was in two house crows that were found dead in Orissa in January of this year.
