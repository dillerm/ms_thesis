France (HPAI H5N1 & H5N2)
The Agriculture Ministry of France has reported that additional cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus have been detected at two separate poultry farms in the Dordogne region. The source of the outbreak was not reported, and all animals in the two affected farms were culled to prevent spread of the disease. The ministry restated to the public that avian influenza cannot be transmitted to humans by consuming food, including meat, eggs, and foie gras. The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported a case of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus in a goose and duck farm in the Dordogne region. The National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease tested one gosling positive for the disease, and the remaining 1,337 birds were culled to prevent further spread of the virus. In addition to culling the following measures were taken: movement control; screening; disinfection; disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; surveillance and zoning. The source of the outbreak is unknown.
