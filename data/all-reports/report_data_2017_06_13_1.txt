USA (H3N8)
H3N8 canine influenza has been confirmed in 12 cases within Florida. Officials believe the disease spread through dog shows and competitions. Georgia has five confirmed cases of the influenza and is asking show attendees to keep dog cages and equipment at least 20 feet from one another. Additionally, hand sanitizer and gloves will be provided at shows in an attempt to avoid spreading the disease further. Dogs from eight states (Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, North and South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas) have tested positive. The best way to prevent the disease is to obtain a canine flu vaccination which doesnâ€™t provide full protection, but will reduce the severity of symptoms. The disease cannot affect humans and is treatable akin to human influenza.
