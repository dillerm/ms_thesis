H5N1 in Poultry in China
Avian influenza has been reported in ducks in the Guangdong province. Though the actual outbreak date where 3,873 ducks died has not been released, another 17,127 ducks were culled after H5N1 was detected on June 13th.Â  Guangdong province is in southern China, adjacent to Hong Kong, where an outbreak in poultry markets led to large-scale culling last week. The affected farm does not supply poultry to Hong Kong, but a farm, located less than 10 km away, is a confirmed supplier to the market.
