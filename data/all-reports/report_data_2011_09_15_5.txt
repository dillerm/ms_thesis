H5N1 in Wild Birds & Poultry
The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has urged heightened readiness and surveillance against a possible resurgence of H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza, as wild bird migrations are expanding areas of infection and a mutant strain is spreading in China and Vietnam. Since 2008, there has been geographic expansion of H5N1 due to wild bird migrations to countries that have been virus-free for several years, such as Israel, the Palestinian Territories, Bulgaria, Romania, Nepal, and Mongolia. FAOâ€™s chief veterinary officer, Juan Lubroth, said that wild birds may introduce the virus but poultry production and marketing spread the virus. Although outbreaks declined from an annual high of 4000 to 302 by mid-2008, there has been an increase in outbreaks with 800 cases reported in 2010-2011. Furthermore, the development of a mutant strain of the virus that is not curbed by current vaccines means there could be a flare-up of infection of H5N1 bird flu this coming fall and winter.
