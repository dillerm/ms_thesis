H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
In the Indramayu Regency in West Java and in Pagedangan in East Java, outbreaks of bird flu was reported on December 5, killing over1,100 ducks and five chickens. Tests conducted at the Veterinary Investigation and Testing Center confirmed all deaths were caused by bird flu.  Infected areas have been disinfected, but the remaining living ducks have not been culled. Instead, the Head of Animal Health Inspector in the Department of Agriculture and Livestock, Dian Daju, is asking owners to keep the remaining ducks caged to prevent the spread of disease. Meanwhile in the Yogyakarta Special Region and Jambi Province of Indonesia, thousands of chickens have died over the past few weeks and officials suspect the deaths to be caused by bird flu. Samples have been sent for testing to confirm the cause of death. While waiting for test results, affected areas are being sprayed with disinfectant to prevent the suspected bird flu virus from spreading.
