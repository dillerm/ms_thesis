Palestinian Authority (HPAI H5N1)
According to a World Organisation for Animal Health report, birds at a farm in Qalqelia, Byat amin have tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus.  Of the 4,200 19-month-old birds, 100 died and the rest will be culled.  The farm will also be disinfected to prevent further spread of the virus.  It is believed the birds contracted the virus through contact with infected materials, such as feed or vehicles.
