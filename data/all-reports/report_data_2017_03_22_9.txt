Taiwan (HPAI H5N2, H5N8, H5N6 and unspecified H5)
Several recent news articles have reported on avian influenza in Taiwan.  As of March 15, countrywide 754,524 birds have been culled at 91 poultry farms so far this season, according to the Council of Agriculture (COA).  Six new outbreaks were reported between 8 and 16 March; details were not provided for four of the outbreaks, except that three involved H5N2 and one involved H5N8.  The fifth outbreak involved H5N6, and occurred at a duck farm in Hualien County: all 14,647 ducks were culled on 9 March.  40 workers involved in that outbreak are being monitored for signs of avian influenza, and two, who had failed to wear protective gear at work, have been given precautionary antivirals.  The sixth outbreak occurred on 16 March, on a farm in Changhua County; 1,277 ducks were culled.  The COA currently requires ducks to be tested for avian influenza before they can be slaughtered for sale, and H5 avian influenza was detected in ducks from this farm during this routine testing.
