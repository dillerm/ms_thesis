Researchers at Toronto's St. Michael's Hospital have developed a system to predict the spread of H1N1 flu. They analyze air traffic patterns around the world to predict how the virus will spread globally. The research team looked at the flight itineraries of more than 2.3 million passengers who departed from Mexico in March and April. They found that countries that received passengers from Mexico were more likely to have cases of H1N1 and that this risk increased when the number of passengers from Mexico increased. Countries that had 1,400 or more passengers from Mexico were at a high risk of importing the virus. The head of the research team, Dr. Kamran Khan, says that they were able to conduct this analysis less than 24 hours after the H1N1 virus appeared. They hope to fine-tune the system so that it will be able to analyze patterns and predict the spread of flu viruses in less than an hour. Researchers would also like to make this information available from anywhere in the world on handheld devices. Information about their project the BIO.DIASPORA Project recently appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine.
