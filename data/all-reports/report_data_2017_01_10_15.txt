Nigeria (HPAI)
Kano State, northern Nigeria, continues to be affected by avian influenza.  A recent report described culling 9,000 birds at two affected poultry farms (depopulating both farms).  Further details about the outbreaks themselves were not provided.  Surveillance and disinfection is being conducted at nearby farms, and an educational campaign is underway to help farmers prevent further spread of the disease. These outbreaks have not been reported to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).
