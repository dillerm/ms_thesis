H5N1 in Humans
Three members of an extended family, a brother (26), sister (15), and a 30-year-old niece, who were part of a household of 33 people have died from H5N1 in the Gharbiya governorate in Egypt. The family had initially denied that they raised ducks at home but the brother and sister had slaughtered the flock after a number of the ducks died.
