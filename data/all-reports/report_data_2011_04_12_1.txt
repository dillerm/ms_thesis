H5N1 in Wild birds
In a paper published recently in the SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, authors Lydia Bourouiba, Stephen A. Gourley, Rongsong Liu, and Jianhong Wu analyze the interaction between non-migratory poultry and migratory birds to investigate the role of the latter in the spread of H5N1 bird flu.  Using mathematical models to simulate the paths of migratory birds along flyways, the researchers demonstrate that the arrival of migratory birds in winter can introduce avian influenza to poultry in disease-free periods. Once the flu becomes endemic in the wintering location, the result is sustenance of the flu in the migratory birds themselves.  "How the interaction of a migratory bird species with domestic poultry contributes to the spread and persistence of the highly pathogenic H5N1 virus is a question of profound importance to the control of avian influenza spread, and to the effort of mitigating the impact of the disease on the domestic poultry industry," said Gourley, a researcher in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Surrey, in a recent press release. The authors suggest that future research should be focused on finding mathematical tools that can predict peak disease times.  Gourley said, â€œMathematical modeling can play a significant role in solving such a complex problem in which experiments are difficult and surveillance data is limited."  In addition, the authors suggest subsequent research with data from international migratory bird surveillance and the commercial poultry trade in an effort to shed more light on these interactions on a global scale.
