UK (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports a new outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza in Wyre, Lancashire, in northern England.  On or before 28 January, clinical signs and several deaths were observed in a flock of about 1,000 breeding pheasants at a game farm where other species are also housed: in total, 66,000 birds are scheduled to be culled.  The outbreak comes after a previous outbreak at a different pheasant farm located less than a kilometer away in Wyre, earlier that week. There is a business link between the two farms. Control measures include movement control inside the country, traceability, disinfection/disinfestation, official disposal of animal products, carcasses, by-products and waste, stamping out, zoning, a 3-kilometer protection zone, and a 10-km surveillance zone.  Vaccination is prohibited and affected animals were not treated. In addition, a news article reported that H5N8 was confirmed at a turkey farm in Lincolnshire, eastern England, on 26 January.  The farm housed 19,500 turkeys; an unspecified number died from the disease, and the remainder have been culled.  A 3-kilometer protection zone and a 10-km surveillance zone are in place around the farm.
