Taiwan (LPAI H5N3)
 The Taiwanese Council of Agriculture confirmed an outbreak of low-pathogenic avian influenza on a duck farm in Hualien County on November 4 while conducting routine surveillance in the wake of previous outbreaks.  Twenty ducks in a flock of 10,000 were tested and found to have the virus. They all were in healthy condition and were “without clinical signs” and the flock did not have “abnormal mortality.”  The source of this outbreak remains unknown and control measures being applied include movement control, screening, and disinfection of the infested area.
