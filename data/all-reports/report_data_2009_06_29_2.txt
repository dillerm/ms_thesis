H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
Although incidences of bird flu are down from last year (9,199 cases), bird flu is still a problem in Jambi Province. The Jambi husbandry office reports that there have been at least 822 cases of bird flu in poultry this year, mostly in Merangin Regency, and urges people to remain vigilant. The department credits the drop in cases to a team set up by the local administration to fight bird flu, which has raised local peopleâ€™s awareness of the virus.
