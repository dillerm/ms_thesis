LPAI H7 in Poultry in Denmark
 The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration confirmed an outbreak of low pathogenic avian influenza H7 on May 31st on a mallard and pheasant farm in Viborg, a city in central Jutland, Denmark.  Because the birds are separated epidemiologically, the 1,400 infected mallards will be culled as soon as possible while the remaining 12,500 pheasants will be closely monitored and tested for the virus.  Additionally, a restricted zone has been established around the farm in the hope that the disease will be prevented from spreading.
