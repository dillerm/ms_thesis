H5N1 in Humans in China
 The Ministry of Health confirmed two new human cases of H5N1 earlier this week, one of them being fatal, in Guizhou province of southwest China.  A 21-year-old woman died after contracting the virus while the other victim, a 31-year old man, is in critical condition.  According to the health officials, â€œno epidemiological connections have been found between the two cases."  Health officials throughout China are on high alert as millions of people are traveling across the country in close-knit quarters to celebrate the Lunar New Year, increasing the risk of spreading infectious diseases.
