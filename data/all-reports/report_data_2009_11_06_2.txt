H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
According to the Animal Health Department, bird flu has re-emerged on nine local farms in the province of Dien Bien. The outbreak began on October 21 and ended October 23, killing hundreds of poultry. Poultry samples tested by a provincial health agency were positive for H5N1. Local animal health authorities are taking precautions to curb the spread of the disease, including the culling of over 2,200 remaining poultry. Dien Bien is the only province in Vietnam currently experiencing a resurgence of the disease and had been free of the virus for several months this year. There have been five human cases of H5N1 in Vietnam this year, four of them fatal.
