H5N1 in Humans in Vietnam
A 23-year-old woman from Thanh Hoa died from bird flu on April 22. She was rushed to the hospital in her district on April 16, but her condition did not improve and she died one day after being transferred to the provinceâ€™s General Hospital. Tests have confirmed that she was infected with the H5N1 strain of bird flu. Chickens in the commune where she lived had recently died in large numbers. Experts are conducting an investigation, disinfecting the area, and testing her relatives for the disease. Earlier, two sisters from the Ba Thuoc province, a 13-year-old and an 8-year-old, had caught the virus. The 13-year-old later died. There have been 111 confirmed human cases of bird flu and 56 deaths in Vietnam since December of 2003.
