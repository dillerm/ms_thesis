India (HPAI H5N1)
According to the Union Health Department, the spread of avian influenza in the Alappuzha and Kottayam districts in Kerala was caused by the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain.  Over 200,000 birds have been culled, and surveillance measures have been put in place in a 10 km radius around the area to prevent spread of the virus. Meanwhile, the virus has spread in southern parts of the state.  It now has a strong presence in the Pathanamthitta and Ernakulam districts.  150 broiler chickens at a farm in Kumarakam died due to the virus, and incidents of ducks dying have been reported in the Kollam district.
