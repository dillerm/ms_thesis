H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A seven-year-old boy from West Java is being treated in Sekarwangi Cibadak regional hospital as patient suspected to have bird flu. Bird flu is suspected because the boy was hospitalized with a high fever and dozens of chickens near his house died suddenly prior to his illness. He is one of the villagers who consumed meat at a wedding reception from chickens that may have been infected and there are eight others with similar symptoms. Doctors are waiting for lab results to confirm the cause of illness.
