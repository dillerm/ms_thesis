H5N1 in Humans in Hong Kong
A 2-month-old girl from the city of Shenzhen has been infected with H9N2, a milder form of the avian influenza virus. The girl hospitalized in Hong Kong and is said to be in stable conditions, according to Thomas Tsang, controller of Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection. The girl was in Shenzhen during her incubation period and officials in Guangdong province are investigating how she became infected. Though the family does not keep poultry and there are no farms nearby, the virus that affected the child has genes that indicate an avian origin. The discovery came on the day that the 21-day suspension on live poultry shipment to Hong Kong resumed.
