H5N1 in Poultry in China
Official sources have reported an H5N1 outbreak in a poultry market (the Jinhuaxin market) in Liwan, a district in the center of Guanzhou, the capital of Guangdong province. However, an official report to the OIE places the outbreak in a rural location, almost 36 km north of the city of Guangzhou. On March 13, 114 chickens died, then 518 were culled. A spokesman for the Hong Kong government said that the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture has notified Hong Kong that an unspecified number of the dead chickens from Jinhauxin tested positive for H5N1. The discovery in southern China comes during the same week as nearby Hong Kong closes schools as a result of an influenza epidemic. In Nanhai, 2,000 chickens belonging to a Sanniao Market vendor, who had supplied chickens to the Jinhuaxin market, were culled. According to reports, all 82,643 chickens in the Sanniao Market have tested negative to the bird flu virus.
