H5N1 in Humans
Researchers have found that a strain of H5N1 bird flu that mutated in pigs in Indonesia has acquired the ability to infect humans. The discovery was made by a team led by virologist Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Tokyo's Institute of Medical Science. Kawaoka is concerned that a highly pathogenic virus that spreads easily to humans could develop without being noticed unless pigs are regularly tested for viruses even when they are asymptomatic. The Japanese researchers, in cooperation with Indonesia's Airlangga University, examined nasal, fecal and serum samples from 702 randomly chosen pigs in 14 provinces from 2005 to 2009. Among 39 H5N1 samples analyzed, one was found to have the ability to attach itself to human nasal or throat cells. The teamâ€™s findings are reported in an article in Emerging Infectious Diseases (see citation for Nidom below).
