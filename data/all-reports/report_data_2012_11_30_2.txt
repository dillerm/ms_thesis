On lakes near the Black Sea in the southern Krasnodar region of Russia, officials recently confirmed that about 4,000 wild ducks have been found dead.  A spokeswoman from Rosselkhoznadzor, Russia’s Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance, said that the birds’ remains are being tested and the H5 virus is being confirmed and blamed for the deaths.  To prevent further outbreaks, poultry and humans are being vaccinated.
