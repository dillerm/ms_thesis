H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
A rapid response team of the District Veterinary Office (DVO), Kathmandu culled all the remaining chickens at a poultry farm in Kathmandu on July 1 after it was confirmed that they were infected with H5N1 bird flu virus. The farm housed 2,000 chickens, out of which, about 600 died from the disease and 1,400 were culled. The owner took some dead chickens to the DVO after they started dying. The Central Animal Health Laboratory confirmed the virus on July 1. "After the laboratory gave positive report, we immediately deployed rapid response team to destroy the chickens in the tainted farm," said Bhola Raj Acharya, chief of Kathmandu DVO. The team will also dispose of chicken feed, eggs and droppings, and disinfect the farm. Officials encourage all poultry farmers and members of the public to take proper care of chickens, inform veterinary officials if chickens are displaying suspicious behavior, cook chicken properly before eating, and wash their hands properly with soap after touching chicken.
