Four separate outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza occurred in the latter half of August in three separate provinces of Vietnam. Two outbreaks were reported in the Quang Tri Province, one in the Thai Binh Province, and lastly, one in the Quang Ngai Province. Samples from each outbreak tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. Out of a total of 3258 chickens and ducks, 871 died and another 2387 birds were culled to inhibit the spread of the virus. Statistics on birds affected and control measures taken for the one of the outbreaks in the Quang Tri Province have not been reported at this time.
