USA (H7N9)
On March 27, 2017 it was reported that Low-pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza has been detected for the first time in Georgia, the United Statesâ€™ leading chicken meat-producing state. The low-pathogenic strain has the potential to mutate into highly pathogenic avian influenza and as a precaution the 18,000 breeder birds have been culled. In Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky over 200,000 breeding chickens have died due or been culled to contain the virus in the past month.
