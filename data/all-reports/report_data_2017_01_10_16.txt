Poland (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports four new outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza in Poland, and Flutrackers.com reports three additional outbreaks. The outbreaks took place between December 21 and 28.  Five of them involved commercial poultry farms in Gorzów County, Lubuskie Province (western Poland); the remaining two outbreaks occurred in a flock of backyard poultry in Malopolska Province, southeastern Poland, and in a flock of 70 ducks and chickens in Swietokrzyskie province, south-central Poland.  All susceptible birds were destroyed at farms involved in the OIE-reported outbreaks; Flutrackers.com did not supply that information for the outbreaks they reported.  Other control measures in place include screening, disinfection/disinfestation, traceability, surveillance within and outside containment and/or protection zone, stamping out, official destruction of animal products, carcasses, by-products and waste, and zoning.
