H5N1 in Poultry in Cambodia
 One outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, was reported earlier this month in the Takeo province of Cambodia.  Officials have been on high alert following the confirmation of a death of a 17-year old girl from Takeo. Since the news of her death, an investigation team from the National Veterinary Research Institute and the Department of Animal Health and Production have been collecting and testing samples from poultry in the affected area.  The team found that 2,304 have died since January 9th and the remaining 4,743 birds were culled to prevent further spread of the virus.  The source of the outbreak remains unknown.  Various control measures being applied include movement control, disinfection of contaminated areas, and dipping/spraying.
