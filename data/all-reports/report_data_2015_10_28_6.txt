WHO
The World Health Organization (WHO) is working with partners in Africa to implement procedures to detect and prepare for influenza outbreaks on the continent.  Currently, little is known about the virus in Africa and its human impact.  Chief among WHO efforts is the development of laboratories to diagnose influenza and a surveillance program for the region.
