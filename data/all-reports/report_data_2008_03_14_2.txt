H5N1 in Wild birds in Vietnam
Four Owston’s palm civets (Chrotogale owstoni) that died in Febuary in the Cuc Phong National Park in Ninh Binh province have tested positive for H5N1. A total of 16 Owston’s civets died between Feburary 8 and March 3. In all, two other Owston's palm civets, two common palm civets (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus), one loris (Loris tardigradus?), two douc langurs (Pygathrix cinerea) and five pee-wit hoopoes (species identification uncertain) have died in recent weeks at the park. All have tested negative for H5N1. A member of the park staff said that the park has only eight civets left. The civets were kept in a “semi-wild” enclosure in the Small Carnivore Conservation Center. The director of the park suspects that civets may have been exposed by infected wild birds entering the enclosure to feed on the food provided to the civets. Three Owston’s palm civets had previously died from H5N1 in the national park in 2005 and it remains unknown how they became infected, but Ninh Binh is one of the nine provinces currently affected by H5N1.
