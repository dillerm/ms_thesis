Ivory Coast (HPAI H5N1)
According to a World Organisation for Animal Health Report, two new cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus have been reported in a backyard flock in the village of Amanibo, Bouake Department and at the main poultry market in Abidjan.  A total of 880 birds died and the remaining 297 were destroyed to prevent further spread of the disease.  The outbreak is believed to have been caused by the introduction of new live animals and contact with wild species.  The affected premises have been quarantined and cleansing and disinfection of all markets in Abidjan is on-going.
