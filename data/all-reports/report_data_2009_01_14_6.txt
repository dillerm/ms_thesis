H5N1 in Poultry in Taiwan
A positive case of LPAI H5N2 avian influenza found on a farm in Tianan County, Taiwan went unreported for almost two months. A report chronicling the outbreak, released in late December, outlines the sudden deaths of 230 poultry and resulting culling of over 18,000 chickens on November 12th, 2008.  The report claims that the information was not released for fear of the negative impact the news would have on China?s trade and commerce. The Council of Agriculture said that the discovery will cost Taiwan tens of millions of dollars in losses, as Taiwan?s chief trading partner for poultry, Japan (which imports $28 million in poultry meat and eggs each year), has suspended the importation of any Chinese poultry products until the situation is clarified.
