H5N1 in Wild birds in Belarus
Border guards confronted an individual on a bicycle trying to smuggle 275 parrots into Belarus (from where not stated).  The border facility could only hold the birds in quarantine for three days. Because testing for bird flu would take over a week, the birds were euthanized,  according to a veterinary service spokesman.
