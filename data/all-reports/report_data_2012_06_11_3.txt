H5N1 in Poultry in Cambodia
An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu at Pring village in Kampong Speu began on May 27. The village was home to 1,304 birds, of which 564 became ill and died. The remaining 740 birds were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. The outbreak was discovered after the death of a 13-year-old girl from H5N1 bird flu on May 27 who lived in the same village. An investigation team from the National Veterinary Research Institute of the Department of Animal Health and Production went to the village to take samples and some tested positive for H5N1. The cause of the outbreak is unknown, but officials are taking preventative measures, such as movement control, disinfection of the premises, and dipping and/or spraying.
