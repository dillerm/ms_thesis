H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 33-year-old resident of Taruko Kuranji is being treated for suspected bird flu in the isolation unit of M Djamil hospital in Padang. The patient has been treated since January 19 and his condition is improving. He was admitted to hospital because of coughing and a runny nose within days of the chickens reared in his house suddenly dying. He buried the dead chickens without reporting the case to Health Service. The hospital is still awaiting laboratory results for bird flu confirmation.
