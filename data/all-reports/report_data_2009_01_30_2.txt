H5N1 in Poultry in Canada
The H5 avian influenza virus has been detected on a turkey farm in Abbotsford, British Columbia. Some birds in the 50,000 bird flock showed signs of respiratory distress on Jan 20th, and the British Columbia provincial laboratory tested and detected a low pathogenic strain of avian influenza. The sequence was 99% related to another H5 virus (H5N2) from California that was found in 2007. The source of the virus is not known, but contact with wild birds is suspected. The 26 farms that fall within a 3 km radius around the infected farm have been placed under quarantine, and a dead bird surveillance program has been instituted. So far all the farms have tested negative.
