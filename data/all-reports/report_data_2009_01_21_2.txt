H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
The first positive incidence of H5N1 in Nepal has been discovered in ducks and chickens in the border town of Kakarvitta near northern India. A local farmer reported that 12 chickens died mysteriously on January 8th, and laboratory tests confirmed that six out of seven chickens tested positive for bird flu. Veterinary workers will cull 13,000 poultry over the next five days within 3 km of the town, though they are meeting resistance from the Poultry Entrepreneurs Union over issues of the low government compensation for lost birds and poultry products. Some 350 farms in the area will be monitored and the importation of poultry from India is being "tightly controlled." Kakarvitta is adjacent to India's West Bengal province, which has been fighting an outbreak of bird flu since December of last year. Nepal is the 63rd country to test positive for bird flu.
