H5N1 in Poultry in Poland
H5N1 has been detected in two turkey farms in the central part of the country, Hilary Januszczyk, the head of the Crisis Management Team said. Sixty birds died from a flock of 1,025 in Mysliborzyce and 300 died from 3,220 at Unejow. Reuters reports that “she said the virus was most likely brought to Poland by migrating ducks, geese or swans.” At least 300 kg of meat from the farms within the cordoned zone and possibly infected with the virus has been sent to retail markets, but the Sanitary Inspector is refusing to indentify which ones or to issue a recall. At a second farm in Mysilborzyce, 2 unspecified birds died and 13 others were destroyed. The outbreak was detected on December 3 according to an OIE report. On December 1 bird flu virus was found in 480 kg of turkey meat in shops in northern Poland. Anna Obuchowska, spokeswoman for the Sanitary Inspectorate in the region said the meat came from two warehouses and most of the meat had been distributed to stores last week. An estimated 7,000 birds may be infected with H5N1 from the affected turkey farms are still in stores across the region, but authorities say that there is no danger to humans.
