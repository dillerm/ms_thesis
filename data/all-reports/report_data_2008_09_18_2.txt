H5N1 in Poultry in Laos
Testing has been completed to trace the origin of last week?s bird flu outbreak in Luangprabang province which resulted in a cull of over 7,000 poultry. ?Trace-back analysis? has identified a farm in Nalae village, Oudomxay province, as the origin of the outbreak. Though no birds tested positive in the suspected farm, another local flock that originated from the suspect farm experienced a 2% mortality and has tested positive for H5N1.  A 5 km surveillance zone has been imposed around the farm in Oudomxay.
