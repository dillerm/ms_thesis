H5N1 in Humans in Vietnam
Hanoi has banned the use of motorcycles and bicycles to transport live poultry into the city as part of the effort to protect the capital from bird flu. As of this week, all live poultry are to be transported in specialized trucks that have been certified as bird flu-free by animal health departments. The announcement came on the same day that two people in Ho Chi Minh City and two others from the southern provinces of Tay Ninh and Vinh Long tested negative for H5N1.
