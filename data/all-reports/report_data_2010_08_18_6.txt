H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu that killed hundreds of chickens in Bengkulu province may have spread to humans. A 19-year-old was admitted to M Yunus regional hospital with suspected bird flu on August 6. The patient had developed a fever and sore throat after burying chickens days before. “We’re treating a bird flu suspect patient in an isolation unit, but we’re still not sure whether the patient has bird flu or not,” director of M Yunus hospital, Dr. Zulman Zuri confirmed. “For now we don’t suspect bird flu infection because patient is getting better after being treated here. We’re collecting throat swab every day for three days and send it to NHIRD, Ministry of Health laboratory. We have done chest x-ray too, but still waiting for the laboratory result,” added Zulman. The hospital has prepared two special rooms for bird flu patients that are guarded and equipped for the safety of patients and health workers.
