Low pathogenic H7N7 bird flu broke out on May 13 at two farms in Cholla-Namdo province. The farms housed a total of 53,300 ducks, all of which were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. The outbreak was discovered when samples were taken by the Jeollanam-do Institute of Livestock and Veterinary Science as part of the avian influenza surveillance program and the samples tested positive for H7 bird flu at the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service on May 20, but the source of the outbreak is unknown. Officials are taking precautionary measures such as disinfection, quarantine, movement control inside the country, and zoning.
