H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 37-year-old man died in isolation at Hasan Sadikin Hospital in West Java on February 9. It is suspected that he had bird flu because he experienced pain in his lungs, other organs, and respiratory system. The spokesman for avian flu control with the hospital, Primal Sudjana, said that the patient suffered respiratory failure on February 7 and the team decided to apply life support. The patient was given Tamiflu and put on a ventilator. According to his family, besides the patient, his wife, and his two children had all been ill, but he had the worst symptoms. Though he had not been in direct contact with birds, his wife reported that their neighbors keep ducks. Samples have been sent to the Health Ministryâ€™s lab in Jakarta to determine the cause of death.
