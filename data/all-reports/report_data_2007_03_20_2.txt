H5N1 in Wild Birds in United Kingdom:
Veterinary Laboratories Association (VLA) praised a group of hunters for their assistance in obtaining wild waterfowl samples from 22 sites across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland as part of an early warning system for HPAI H5N1. Peter Marshall, the research officer for BASC, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said "The team of wildfowlers who took part in the avian flu monitoring sent in over 700 samples to the VLA which is a great achievement. Thanks to the efforts of our wildfowling members the VLA has also isolated other strains of avian influenza which they would not otherwise have had access to."
