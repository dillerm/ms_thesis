H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A factory worker has died from bird flu in Banten Province. The 19 year old was hospitalized on July 29th near Jakarta and died two days later. Another man died in the same province two weeks before this incident, bringing the number of human fatalities in Indonesia to 112 ? the highest worldwide. Three people have died and 13 have been admitted to hospitals with bird flu-like symptoms in Northern Sumatra. Two of the patients, a baby and a seven year old, have been transferred to the isolation unit in the provincial capital, Medan, and their samples are being sent to a ministry lab in Jakarta for testing. A team of epidemiologists have been sent to investigate a nearby village where residents have reported a large number of dead chickens and several pigeons in the area. Local husbandry office chief Oktoni Eryanto said "We have taken measures since Tuesday when we found strong indications of bird flu virus in some 100 chickens and ducks in several places in Air Batu village." Some 400 birds have been killed and their cages disinfected. "We don't need to send samples from the poultry to a laboratory because it's pretty clear that the cause is the bird flu virus," Eryanto said.
