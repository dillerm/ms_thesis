H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
Twenty-seven birds from a flock of 53 in a village in Cao Bang province died of H5N1 bird flu. The other 26 were destroyed to prevent the spread of the disease. Other preventative measures have been taken, such as quarantine, movement control inside the country, disinfection of infected premises, and modified stamping out. The outbreak may have been caused by illegal movement of animals, introduction of new live animals, or fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.). Tests at the National Center for Veterinary Diagnosis confirmed H5N1 bird flu.
