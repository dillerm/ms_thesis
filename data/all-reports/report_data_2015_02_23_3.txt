USA (HPAI H5N2, H5N8)
Wild ducks in Columbia, Morrow, Lane, and Canyon Counties, Oregon have tested positive for a reasserted highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus mixed with the Eurasian H5N8 strand.  The birds, all harvested by hunters, included three mallards, two northern pintails, a wood duck, and a northern shoveler.  The birds were all harvested at the beginning of the year, but were reported this week to the World Organisation for Animal Health. In addition to enhanced surveillance, all backyard premises have been quarantined.
