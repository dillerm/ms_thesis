H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
A special team of livestock officials culled around 1,000 birds on a private farm in Gaibandha on February 12 after bird flu was detected. A few poultry from the farm had died recently and a livestock officer collected samples from dead poultry and sent them to Gaibandha Regional Animal Disease Diagnosis Centre where they tested positive. In Rajshahi, around 8,600 chickens on a farm were culled and dumped on February 16 following the detection of bird flu. The owner of the farm informed livestock officers a few days earlier that chickens on his farm had been dying. A sample from an infected chicken sent to the Central Diseases Investigation Laboratory (CDIL) in Dhaka tested positive for bird flu.
