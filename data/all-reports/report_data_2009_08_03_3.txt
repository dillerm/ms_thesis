Australia.
“Swine flu” has been detected in a piggery near Dunedoo in New South Wales, Australia. The virus has been identified as an A/H1, but is not clear whether it is the same pandemic H1N1 (2009) strain that is affecting people around the world. The farm is isolated with no poultry nearby and no new animals have been introduced for two years. The outbreak began on July 24. The pigs are believed to have caught the disease from workers, as five of the workers are infected, according to press reports. This is the first time that pigs in Australia have tested positive for influenza.
