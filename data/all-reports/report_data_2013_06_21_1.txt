Avian Influenza in Wild birds in Netherlands
Dutch scientists at Wageningen University successfully sequenced the genome of the mallard, which, according to the research team, will “provide good leads for further research into exactly how this virus (influenza A) affects birds, and in the long-term, also humans.” Humans and mallards share some of the same infection-fighting defense mechanisms, and studying the differences between how mallards and humans fight off infections, specifically influenza, will help scientists “find ways of controlling the infection process with medication in humans.”
