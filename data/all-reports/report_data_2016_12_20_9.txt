Hungary (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports 32 new poultry-farm outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza in Hungary.  The outbreaks occurred between November 25 and December 6, in the counties of Bács-Kiskun, Csongrád, and Békés in southern Hungary.  Turkeys, chickens, geese, and ducks were involved; one of the outbreaks occurred in a backyard flock and the rest were commercial farms.  The report does not provide information about the number of cases, deaths, or destroyed animals, and the laboratory tests used to confirm the presence of H5N8 are not reported.  Control measures include movement control inside the country, disinfection/disinfestation, traceability, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, zoning, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, and stamping out.  Vaccination is prohibited, and there has been no treatment of affected animals.
