Palestinian Territories (Suspect HPAI H5N1)
4,000 birds at a poultry farm in Siris, near Jenin in the Palestinian Territories have died from the disease, with 5,000 other potentially affected birds being culled. This location is immediately next to the Hazafon location in Israel. According to the Ministry of Agriculture, avian influenza virus has been detected in a poultry farm in the Qalqiliya district.  The strain is unknown, but is suspected to be H5N1, the same strain found recently in the village of Siris in Jenin.  Of the 5,000 hens at the farm, 4,000 have been culled.  Villages within 10 kilometers of the farm have been placed under surveillance and samples have been taken to prevent further spread of the disease.
