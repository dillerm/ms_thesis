The highly pathogenic H5N1 virus has been discovered at a turkey farm in Kfar Vitkin.  37,000 turkeys will be culled to prevent spread of the disease.  The farm will be disinfected and closed for 30 days.  Other farms within a 10 km radius will be placed under quarantine for 30 days and undergo inspection.  A total of 157,000 birds have been culled in the past two weeks in Northern Israel due to the virus.
