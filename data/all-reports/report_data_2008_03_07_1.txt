H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
An Oriental magpie robin, found dead on Feb. 29 in the Tai Po Kau Nature Reserve, has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza.  Tai Po Kau, the largest nature reserve in Hong Kong,  is the home to the largest secondary forest in Hong Kong, and is considered the best site in the territories to observe forest birds, according to the Hong Kong Bird Watchers Society. A chicken farm located within 3 km of the index location has not reported any unusual deaths. The area near the management center where the bird was found will be thoroughly cleaned, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said.
