H5N1 in Domestic   Animals
Bird flu has been   detected in illegally raised ducklings in two different farms in the southern   province of Kien Giang in Vietnam.  The discovery marks a total of 41 communes   in 17 districts in four provinces (Ca Mau, Bac   Lieu, Hau Giang and Kien Giang) that have been affected in the current H5N1   outbreak in that country.  The WHO and the FAO have   announced a mission to Vietnam to investigate the origin of these   outbreaks.
