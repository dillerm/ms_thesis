H5N1 in Humans in Vietnam
A four-year-old girl in Dong Thap province is suffering from suspected bird flu after possible exposure to dead birds. The birds have been sent to a veterinary agency for testing. Ly Thi Hang, a twenty-six-year-old woman from Soc Trang province, died on March 20 from what had been thought to be H5N1 bird flu, but tests performed by the HCM City Pasteur Institute revealed that she was not infected with bird flu. Testing confirmed that a three-year-old boy from Dong Thap province who died on March 19 was infected with H5N1.
