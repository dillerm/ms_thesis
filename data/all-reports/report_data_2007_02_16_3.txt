H5N1 in Wild Birds in Japan:
H5N2 has been found in samples from three waterfowl  collected between November 4 and December 14, 2006, at a lake in Fukui  Prefecture in western Japan by the National Institute of Infectious Disease.   The institute had been conducting a survey of waterfowl droppings from  around the country.  The virus is not suspected to be connected with the  series of HPAI H5N1 outbreaks in domestic poultry in Japan this year, and so  far no HPAI H5N1 isolations have been reported from wild birds during the  national survey.
