H5N1 in Poultry in Togo
Bird flu has been confirmed at a farm in the village of Agbata, near the capital of Lome.  Togo?s health ministry did not disclose how many birds died in the outbreak, but the farm houses almost 4500 chickens.  Samples have been sent to labs in Ghana and Italy to determine if the strain is H5N1.  Togo has not seen a case of H5N1 since January, but Benin, its neighbor to the east, has recently seen a number of H5N1 outbreaks.
