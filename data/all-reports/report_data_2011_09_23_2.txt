H5N1 in Wild birds in Netherlands
 In the Dutch province of Drenthe, low pathogenic avian influenza was found in 83 swans scheduled to be exported.  According to European regulations, kept animals not defined as poultry need not be culled.  Since the swans are located in an area void of poultry farms, the swans will remain in quarantine under supervision of the Food and Consumer Product Safety Authority until the infected birds no longer excrete the bird flu virus.  To prevent the disease from spreading, the transportation of live birds and eggs has been prohibited within 1 kilometer of the swansâ€™ holding area.
