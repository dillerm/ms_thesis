An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu on a backyard poultry farm in Chukha district began on January 8 and was reported to OIE on March 1. The farm housed 123 animals, of which 37 became ill and 35 died. The remaining 88 birds were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Samples from the birds tested positive for H5N1 at the National Centre for Animal Health on January 10. The source of the outbreak is unknown, but control measures such as stamping out, movement control, screening, disinfection of the premises, and dipping/spraying have been put in effect.
