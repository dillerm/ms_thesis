Bangladesh.
Up to 15,000 poultry firms have been affected by bird flu, which has cut chicken production by more than 33 percent, according to Syed Abu Siddique, president of the Bangladesh Poultry Industries Association. The number of affected farms is significantly higher than the 153 reported by the government so far. The government has exempted the industry from several taxes for the next couple of years to boost growth; however, industry officials fear tax breaks will not be enough to revive self-sufficiency in bird and egg production without vaccines and improved control measures for bird flu. In the Khulna District, a livestock farm experienced an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu beginning on June 22. On this farm, 231 birds died and the remaining 869 birds were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. The source of this outbreak is unknown, but control measures such as movement control and disinfection of the premises have been instituted. The Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute tested samples on June 24.
