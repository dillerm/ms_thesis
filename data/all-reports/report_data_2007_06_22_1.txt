H5N1 in Wild Birds in Hong Kong:
A bird shop in the Yuen Po Street Bird Garden  closed following the detection of H5N1 in a Daurian starling (Sturnus  sturninus). The fecal sample was collected on June 4 as part of routine  surveillance at the market.  Bird Garden has about 70 shops where 200 swab  samples are collected each month for testing; now all the stores are closed and  being cleaned and disinfected.  Last year, over 3,000 samples had been  tested and all were negative. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation  Department is attempting to locate the original owner of the starling who is  said to have “left” the bird two weeks ago at the pet shop. All the birds in  the store have been removed for testing.  A number of bird deaths have  occurred near the area, and according to a local infectious disease expert,  around 60% of the H5-positive samples found in Hong Kong have been found near  the market.
