H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
Bird flu is spreading in eight subdistricts of the East Lampung District, according to the head of the Participatory Disease Surveillance Program. The virus is present in at least 12 villages, but the local farmers are opposed to culling their poultry to stop the spread. East Lampung and the adjacent districts of Central Lampung and Bandarlampung have had several outbreaks over the past few years.
