H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
It was announced on January 26 that hundreds of chickens in Jambi province have died from bird flu. The head of the Tebo district animal husbandry and fishery office said "According to the results of laboratory tests, the dead chickens had been infected with the H5N1 virus that causes Avian Influenza." Another 5,500 chickens in two villages in Pirbalingga district in Central Java province have died of bird flu, according to local authorities, who instituted control measures including disinfection, testing, and vaccination. Lampung province also experienced an outbreak of bird flu in January that killed at least 1,176 birds. Residents of Lampung are concerned that thousands of chickens owned by poultry company PT Central Avian Pertiwi have died of bird flu. The birds originally tested negative for bird flu, but when samples were retested at the Lampung Livestock and Animal Husbandry Agency lab, they were positive for H5N1. Twelve thousand laying hens have been culled and tens of thousands of other birds have been quarantined. The poultry farm is now under the supervision of the Tanjungkarang Veterinary Agency, Lampung Husbandry Office and South Lampung Livestock Agency. There are currently outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in five districts of Lampung.
