H5N1 in Poultry in Hong Kong
On the outlying island of Lantau in Hong Kong, three dead birds washed up on a beach and all tested positive for H5N1. Ten more birds were found earlier this week and will be tested. Villagers on Lantau Island said that dead birds have been washing up on shore in recent days and they suspect the birds are being carried from mainland China on the Pearl River. 'If they are from the mainland, something very terrible could be happening across the border,' Lo Wing-Lok, a legislator and chairman of the Hong Kong Medical Association said.
