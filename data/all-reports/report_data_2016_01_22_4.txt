The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have reported 23 cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in farms and backyards in the states of Adamawa, Bauchi, Delta, Ebonyi, Enugu, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, and Plateau. As many as 6,384 birds have died from the disease, and over 90,000 have been culled to prevent it spreading further. Samples from all cases listed were confirmed to be avian influenza by the National Veterinary Research Institute, Vom. In addition to culling, the following control measures have been implemented: movement control; disinfection; quarantine; stamping out; surveillance; and official disposal of animal carcasses, products, by-products, and waste. The source of theses outbreaks is unknown, but poor farm biosecurity was observed.
