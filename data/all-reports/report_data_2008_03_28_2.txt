H5N1 in Poultry in India
At the State Poultry Farm in Malda, West Bengal, over 1,000 birds have died and blood samples have tested positive for H5N1 at the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal. The remaining 15,000 birds at the affected farm and some 44,000 chickens and ducks in the surrounding area will all be destroyed. Culling operations were temporarily suspended to celebrate the holiday of Holi, the festival of color, but had resumed at the beginning of this week. Bird flu spread into another district this week when the virus was found in backyard flocks in the village of Baolmari in the district of Jalpaiguri. Jalpaiguri is the third district to be affected by bird flu after Murshidabad and Malda. Samples have tested positive for H5N1, according to officials.
