H5N1 in Wild Birds
Vincent Martin of the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organizations spoke at an international meeting in Nanchang, China, and stated that migratory birds have not played a major role in the spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1. Instead, highly concentrated domestic poultry-production practices and the use of "centuries-old practices" that place humans and poultry in close proximity, especially in Asia, poses the most risk. Martin said that wild migratory birds play only a minor role in the long-distance spread of H5N1, and trade in poultry and poultry products has played more of a role. The World Health Organization (WHO) released a report this week saying “in terms of geographical spread of the virus, mallard ducks are now regarded as the “champion” vectors; mute swans are highly susceptible birds that are thought to serve as sentinels, but probably not as vectors of virus transmission.” At the meeting, scientists presented evidence that there was a change in the pattern of HPAI H5N1 shedding, with increased shedding from the respiratory tract rather than the cloaca. Further, a “corresponding change in sampling strategies – including both cloacal and pharyngeal swabs – is called for to get a true picture of the situation. The latest round of surveillance in Azerbaijan included the testing of "pathological materials" from 41 wild birds; blood samples from 10 wild birds have been completed. No sign of "bird flu" was found in any of the specimens."
