H5N1 in Poultry in Ghana.
Two additional outbreaks in poultry farms have been detected less than a week after H5N1 was first found in Ghana.  Dr. Darlington Owusi, the head of the Avian Influenza Surveillance team, said that several crates of eggs and about 500 birds have been destroyed at one site. He suggested that the virus may have spread from a nearby poultry farm where 12,000 birds, 323 crates of eggs and 375 kilos of feed have been destroyed. Details on the H5N1 testing in both cases have not been released at this time. (more...)
