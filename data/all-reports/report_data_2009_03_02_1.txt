H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
A crested mina found dead at Sha Tau on Feb. 13 has tested positive for H5N1. According to Cheung Ho-Fai, the president of the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society, all of the wild birds that have tested positive for H5N1 share the trait of eating dead birds and garbage. He states, “There were dead domestic poultry with bird flu virus found at Hong Kong’s seaside first, and then the wild birds were infected. So I think it is clear that the wild birds were infected by the infected dead poultry.”
