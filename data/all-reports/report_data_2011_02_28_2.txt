H5N1 in Wild birds in UK
Bird lovers in Stratford-upon-Avon requested an urgent investigation after 16 swans died in just 6 weeks on the River Avon. Wildlife experts are calling for the carcasses to be tested, fearing that the birds may have died from bird flu. Swan rescue volunteer and former Stratford Mayor Cyril Bennis said: “This is the worst case of deaths I’ve seen in 30 years of working with swans in Stratford. I picked up three this week; two from Stratford and one from Luddington and it was quite distressing. I’ve collected all the dead birds, some young and some old; many have been very thin. Is it lead poisoning or is it Bird Flu? We just don’t know – but the problem is not going away. I think we are looking at a virus and have called for the river to be checked but all this costs money.’’ He added that the swan population on the river is down to 35 and cannot sustain this many deaths. Veterinarians at the Arden Forest Veterinary Group have been investigating, but the carcasses they have received have been too degraded for a successful post-mortem. They are calling for residents to report any dead swans so that professionals can retrieve them safely and quickly. Wychbold Swan Rescue has 150 swans at a nearby rescue center and has put release plans on hold until the cause of the recent deaths has been determined.
