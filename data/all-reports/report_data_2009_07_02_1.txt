New cases of H1N1 flu in Indonesia have increased scientists concerns that H1N1 could mix with the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain. Siti Fadillah Supari, the Indonesian Health Minister, voiced her concerns that such a mixture might be possible after her agency confirmed six new H1N1 cases on June 28. Flu strains mutate and mix quickly as can be seen with the current H1N1 virus, which is already a mixture of different influenza viruses. H5N1 has been circulating in Asia for years and has hit Indonesia particularly hard. Scientists say that as a virus becomes more easily transmissible between people it also usually becomes less deadly, but there is no guarantee that this will always happen. Even if the two viruses do not combine, experts are worried that there will be more deaths from H1N1 in populous, developing countries like Indonesia, India, and Egypt.
