H5N1 in Poultry in South Korea.
Ducks at a second farm in Youngwon-myeon, Jeongeup District (North Jeolla province) located less than 30 km from Gimje, where H5N1 was detected last week, have tested positive for H5N1. The Food and Agriculture Ministry said that some 6,000 ducks have died at the farm since March 31 and about 6,500 ducks at the farm will be destroyed. However, the report to OIE lists 8,380 ducks dead and 154,690 destroyed in an outbreak that began on April 3rd. An additional 6,500 ducks were sent from the farm to a slaughterhuse in Naju prior to the discovery of bird flu. The Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said that birds will not be distributed to market and the facility at Naju along with the vehicles used to transport the ducks and the 13 farms that they had contact with will be decontaminated.
