H5N1 in Humans in Vietnam
On January 16, an 18-year-old man from the Kien Giang province in Vietnam died after contracting bird flu. The man was hospitalized only a day earlier with symptoms of a high fever and respiratory problems. No sick or dead poultry have been reported on the two farms where the man worked or among neighboring flocks. Samples have been collected for analysis, and the farms have been disinfected. However, many of the ducks from one of the farms had already been sold before samples were collected. The manâ€™s house has been disinfected and local residents remain under surveillance for symptoms of bird flu. This is the first avian influenza related death in Vietnam since April 2010.
