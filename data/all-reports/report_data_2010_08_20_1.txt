H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
The head of Jakarta’s Agriculture, Maritime and Animal Husbandry Agency, Jawilhija, said “Seventy percent of samples taken from the faeces of thousands of birds were avian flu positive, even though the birds appeared healthy.” She added that meat from the birds did not pose a danger to humans as long as it was cooked well. Last year there were 44 human cases of bird flu in Jakarta, but so far there have only been 2 cases this year. Nevertheless, officials are wary of a future outbreak. A new bylaw will require owners of pet birds to certify their animals and restrict poultry slaughterhouses to six areas on the periphery of the city.In West Kalimantan province, the Agriculture, Livestock and Fishery Service confirmed an outbreak of H5N1. They examined 21 birds; 8 of which tested positive for bird flu. The head of the Agriculture, Livestock and Fishery Service of Sintang, Arbudin said, “In June we dispatched a team as soon as we received reports, but the test was negative. Also for July, but during August, again we received reports of chicken deaths and did rapid tests in two suspected areas.” Since H5N1 was confirmed, officials enacted control and prevention measures such as depopulating birds around suspected areas, mapping outbreak points, and inspecting chicken transport vehicles. In Bengkulu province, 33 villages are undergoing bird flu outbreaks. Officials have culled around 4,500 chickens and ducks in order to prevent the disease from spreading.
