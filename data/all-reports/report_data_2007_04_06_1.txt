H5N1 in Wild Birds in Hong Kong.
Hong Kong has tested 3,430 wild birds so far this year  and 15 of them have tested positive for H5N1. All of the viruses are the  “Fujian” strain of the virus, the same strain that has been found in almost all  poultry and some human cases in Southern China and has also been found in Laos  and Thailand. According to a news report, “Hong Kong sources confirm that  diseased migratory birds died in large numbers in periods when China did not  report any infections in the area.  They fear that the virus is far more  widespread than official Chinese data claims, given the lack of information  forthcoming from Beijing regarding new cases of infection among poultry and humans.”
