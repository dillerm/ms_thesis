Korea (HPAI H5N6)
A provincial government official reports that highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N6) was found in two dead cats in the city of Pocheon in South Korea 2 kilometers from a chicken farm. A domestic cat mated with a stray female; both parents and three of the kittens have died, and H5N6 was detected in the male and one of the kittens. The government has “sterilized” farms and ponds within 10 km of where the cats died. Twelve people who had contact with the two positive cats have been placed on antivirals. Two dogs raised together with the cats have tested negative. The government will test stray cats in heavily affected districts elsewhere in the country to determine the extent of their exposure to H5N6.
