H5N1 in Wild birds in Russia
Russia announced plans to develop a bird flu vaccine for wild birds within two years. Russia’s chief veterinarian at the food safety watchdog organization said that between 2% and 80% of the domestic birds culled test positive for “bird flu” and that “bird flu” has never really disappeared from Russia since 2005. However, the number of domestic birds culled has dropped from 1.3 million in 2005, to 1 million in 2006, to 260,000 in 2007.
