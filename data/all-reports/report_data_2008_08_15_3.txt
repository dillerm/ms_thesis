Investigations have not been able to determine the cause of death for 3 villagers and test results are still pending, but other villagers have been tested and are not infected with bird flu. In the aftermath of the case, Promed has announced that it will no longer report human cases until confirmation by the Indonesian Ministry of Health has been received.Also in Asahan, 276 infected birds were destroyed and 1126 birds were destroyed in a nearby village after hundreds suddenly died last week. According to the Vice Regent Sudarwanto, bird flu has affected six subdistricts of North Rantau: Cendana, Lobusona, Padang Bulan, Padang Matinggi, Sirandorung, and Ujung Bandar.A fall in the mortality rate in Indonesia was announced by the National Commission of Bird Flu Control and Alertneess. The rate fell from 88.1% in 2007 to 84.2% in 2008, the executive chairman of the Commission said. In 2006 34/43 human H5N1 cases resulted in fatalities, while 23/27 human H5N1 cases occurred in 2007. So far in 2008, there are a total of 16 fatalities from 19 cases reported, and improvements are still needed to identify human cases earlier. Toni Wandra, from the Indonesian Ministry of Health, said that patients took an average of six days before seeking hospital treatment and the average time before initiation of treatment with antivirals was seven days. Most patients had non-specific symptoms during the first two days, with only 31/127 patients reporting fever and cough, but starting treatment within two days was associated with significantly lower mortality.
