H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
In North Jakarta, a 24-year-old man died on January 7, due to infection of the H5N1 avian influenza virus. This was the country’s third fatal case in as many months. The man’s symptoms began on December 31. He was twice misdiagnosed with gastric infection and dengue fever. On January 6, he was rejected by the Sulianto Suroso infection diseases hospital because the intensive care unit was full. The virus was confirmed by the health ministry’s research agency and is believed to have come from a sick pigeon around the man’s house. Additionally, it was confirmed that the death of a 21 year-old man in West Jakarta in September 2007, was due to the H5N1 virus.
