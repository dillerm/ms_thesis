South Korea (HPAI H5N8)
South Korea imposed a 12-hour lockdown on Monday on poultry farms in three provinces to curb a spreading bird flu outbreak first reported at a duck farm in Gochang, 300 kilometers southwest of Seoul. The H5N8 strain of bird flu has since been identified in 18 other farms, with tests being carried out in 21 others. More than 640,000 poultry have been destroyed, and 810,000 more have been targeted to be destroyed as a result of the outbreak. Control measures being applied include control of wildlife reservoirs, stamping out, quarantining, movement control inside the country, zoning, disinfection of infected premises/establishments, and the prohibition of vaccination or treatment of affected animals.
