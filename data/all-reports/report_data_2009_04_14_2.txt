H5N1 in Poultry in USA
A single broiler/breeder farm in western Kentucky, which produces hatching eggs for Perdue Farms Inc., is being investigated by state and federal officials because of a suspected non-pathogenic or low-pathogenic avian influenza finding. After a minor drop in egg production Perdue Veterinarians tested birds and found antibodies for avian influenza. The National Veterinary Services Laboratory and the Breathitt Veterinary Center confirmed that these antibodies were from an H7 strain. State Veterinarian Robert C. Stout has quarantined the farm and Perdue is planning to cull 20,000 chickens from two houses. According to Dr. Stout â€œThe state and federal government and Perdue are acting aggressively to contain and eliminate the disease. There is no evidence that any infected poultry are in the human food supply as a result of this infection. We will do what is necessary to minimize the disruption to overseas trade." The Kentucky Department of Agriculture is conducting surveillance on backyard flocks within a two-mile radius of the farm.
