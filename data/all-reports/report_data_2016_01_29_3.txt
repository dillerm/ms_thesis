Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has reported 17 new cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in birds in the states of Kaduna, Kano, and Plateau, and the Federal Capital Territory. Confirmed by the National Veterinary Research Institute, 4,034 birds died of the disease, and the remaining 59,293 were culled to prevent further spread. In addition to culling, the following measures were applied: movement control; disinfection; quarantine; surveillance; stamping out; and official destruction of animal products. Traceability will be implemented at a later time. The cause of the outbreak is unknown, but poor farm biosecurity was reported at all locations.
