H5N1 in Wild birds in UK
Bird flu has been ruled out as a cause of death in seven swans on the Seiont River. The swans died on June 11 near the Aber Swing Bridge, Caernarfon, over 300 miles from a swannery in Abbotsbury where 11 birds died of avian influenza beginning in January, and 200 miles from a June 3rd avian influenza outbreak in Oxfordshire. Tests have ruled out bird flu, but the exact cause of death has not yet been determined.
