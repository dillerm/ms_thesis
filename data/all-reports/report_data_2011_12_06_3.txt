H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
In the last week of November, thousands of chickens died from H5N1 bird flu in South Sulawesi Province. Individual farmers are taking precautions such as disinfecting their farms after die-offs, but until recently the Livestock Service had not taken measures to control the outbreak. Shortly after, outbreaks were reported in 3 subdistricts of West Java Province. A spokesman of the Livestock Service reported that birds from 5 farms tested positive for H5N1 bird flu and samples from the dead chickens were sent to the Veterinary Disease Investigation Center. Control measures such as disinfection, culling, and vaccination have been implemented.
