H5N1 in Wild birds in India
 During the last week of November, deaths of between 500 and 1,000 crows were reported in various areas of the eastern state of Jharkhand in India. The National Institute of Virology has found the presence of H5N1 bird flu in the dead crows. In addition, the Institute of Veterinary Research has collected carcasses and is conducting tests to confirm the cause of death of the crows. Residents of Jharkhand claim that the deaths of crows began in September 2011, but the deaths have only recently caught media attention.
