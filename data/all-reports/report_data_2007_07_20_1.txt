H5N1 in  Wild Birds in Philippines
In the Phillipines, the government seized 281 exotic birds, mostly 
				    green-naped lorikeets (Trichoglossus haematodus) in Davao City  that had been illegally imported 
				    from Indonesia. All of the seized birds were euthanized and then 
				    incinerated, officials said. Authorities are also tracing other birds 
				    that might have been smuggled at the same time. This led the  secretary 
				    of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources to remind the 
				    public about the danger of importing birds from Indonesia. The 
				    Philippines remains the only country in the area to be free of bird-flu and has been especially vigilant as to the legal and illegal importation  of poultry and wild birds.
