H5N1 in Poultry in South Korea
On February 13, two additional bird flu outbreaks were confirmed in areas near Seoul despite nationwide efforts to stem the spread of the disease. The farm ministry said that the two new locations, a medium-sized duck farm and a small poultry farm that raises chickens and ducks, had reported symptoms earlier in the week. All 8,400 birds on the two farms have been culled and buried and other bird farms within a 3-km radius are being checked for infections. Since December 31 when the first two avian influenza outbreaks were confirmed, cases have been reported in five provinces and 5.45 million birds have been destroyed at 249 farms so far.
