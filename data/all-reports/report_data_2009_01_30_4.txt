H5N1 in Humans in Nepal
Chickens have been found dead in the capital of Kathmandu this week, but avian influenza has not been confirmed as the cause of death. "After carrying out preliminary tests in Nepal, samples have been sent to UK for the confirmation," said the Ministry of Agriculture and Cooperatives. The lack of a reference laboratory in Nepal means that even negative samples are sent to London for further testing. The first ever introduction of H5N1 in Nepal was discovered last week in the border region of Jhapa. Culling operations are nearing completion according to Nepal authorities.
