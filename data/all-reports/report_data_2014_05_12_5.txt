China (H5N6)
Chinese health officials confirmed the first human case of H5N6 on May 7. The victim, a 49-year-old man from the Sichuan Province, had been in contact with dead, infected poultry and became seriously ill on April 22. Experts believe that this is an isolated case and the risk of human-to-human contact is very low. In hopes to prevent further outbreaks, over 1,300 birds throughout the province have been culled, poultry farms are being closely monitored, and health officials remain on high alert.
