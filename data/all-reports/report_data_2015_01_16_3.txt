Taiwan (HPAI H5N2 and H5N8)
According to Su-san, director general of the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, birds on 65 goose and duck farms in central and southern parts of Taiwan have tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5N2 and H5N8 strains of avian influenza.  Around 16,500 geese and ducks have been culled.  All poultry slaughter houses have been ordered by animal health authorities to cease operations for two days to carry out sterilization.  Additional control measures include testing of poultry within a 3-kilometer radius and movement restrictions across the island.  The H5N2 strain is a new recombinant and was discovered through DNA testing to be a hybrid of a H5N8 strain that was responsible for outbreaks in poultry in South Korea last year and China in 2011.   It has not been found in humans.  These outbreaks mark the first time the H5N8 strain has been identified in Taiwan.  So far only ducks and geese have tested positive, but authorities are on alert after a report that chickens on a farm in Tainan   have mysteriously begun dying.
