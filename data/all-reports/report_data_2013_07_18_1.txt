Avian Influenza in Wild birds in India
In Cubbon Park, in the Indian state of Karnataka, officials recently placed a sign reading ‘Feeding pigeon leads to bird flu disease; please avoid feeding pigeons. Warning: fine Rs 100.’ While there is currently no scientific evidence that links feeding pigeons to the contraction of H5N1, officials hoped the sign would prevent people from standing on the side of the road to feed the birds. According to Dr. Sudharshan Ballal, medical director at the Manipal Hospital and a specialist in H1N1, by and large feeding pigeons does not lead to bird flu. "Some of the birds’ excreta may contain the virus and, in a crowd, the infection could spread. But people don’t catch bird flu just by feeding pigeons. There is no need to get alarmed."
