India (HPAI H5N1)
The High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory in Bhopal, after sequencing the genome of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus discovered in the Thorrur village of the Rangareddy District of Telangana last month, has discovered it is a match to a virus that caused an outbreak in Chhattisgarh two years ago.  It was not a match to the strain which caused outbreaks in Kerala, Karnataka, and Chandigarh last year, however.  These findings raise questions if the virus made its way to Hyderabad from the neighboring Chhattisgarh or if it has been around for a while and may have infected birds in other states.
