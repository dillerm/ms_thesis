H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
According to government officials, a 27-year-old man from Prey Veng province died on April 17 after contracting H5N1 bird flu. The man died of respiratory complications after experiencing a high fever. This is the 10th confirmed case of bird flu in a human since 2004 and the 8th death. “Avian Influenza H5N1 is still a threat to the health of Cambodians,” Minister of Health Mam Bunheng said in Wednesday’s statement. “I urge communities to be on the lookout for sick poultry and report poultry die-offs to the Ministry of Health or Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries hotlines, so that they can be investigated before people start to get sick.”
