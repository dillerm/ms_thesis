H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
According to the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department, a barn swallow found dead on March 26 in Yuen Long tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The Mai Po Nature Reserve in Yuen Long will be closed to visitors for 21 days beginning from March 31 as a precaution. Five chicken farms within a three kilometer radius of the spot where the bird was found were inspected by departmental staff and no abnormal mortalities or symptoms of bird flu were found. The farms will be placed under enhanced surveillance. The department will also increase the inspection of poultry farms, the wholesale market, and the Yuen Po Street Bird Garden.
