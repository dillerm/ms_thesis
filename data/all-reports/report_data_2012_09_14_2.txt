H3N2 Variant in Humans in United States
 Incidents of swine flu are on the rise this year.  To date, 297 people have caught a variant H3N2 virus from pigs in the U.S; one died, and 16 were hospitalized.  Additionally, it has been reported that pigs in Korea may be carrying a strain of flu that is more dangerous and contagious than the controversial, experimental bird flu of last year.  The recent increase in swine flu has scientists worried that not enough flu sampling and testing is being done to help prevent future outbreaks and continues the debate over if researchers should produce and publish information about such harmful viruses.
