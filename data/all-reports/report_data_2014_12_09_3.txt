Avian Influenza in Poultry in The Netherlands (HPAI H5N8)
Dutch animal health authorities have detected the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus at a poultry farm in the western municipality of Zoeterwoude. 28,000 hens were destroyed at the location and another 50,000 birds will be destroyed at a nearby farm as a precautionary measure. This follows the culling of around 300,000 birds at four other poultry farms. Testing indicates that the infections were not all from the same source. Authorities are testing poultry at nearby farms, and transport restrictions were imposed two weeks ago that affect around 2,000 poultry businesses in the sector. Some experts think that wild birds emigrating from Asia carried the disease to Europe.
