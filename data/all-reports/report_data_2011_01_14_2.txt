H5N1 in Wild birds in South Korea
South Korea's farm ministry reported on December 28 that it found 20 dead spectacled teal ducks, apparently infected with H5N1 bird flu, and has taken emergency decontamination measures. The birds were identified as mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) in the official report to OIE, but some veterinarians in the country said they are likely to be Baikal Teal (Anas formosa) instead. The dead birds were found 430 km south of Seoul and were the third group of birds reported dead from H5N1 in South Korea in December.Five wild ducks were found dead near Jumoon-ri, Sacheon City on December 26. One of the birds has been confirmed to be infected with H5N1 in the official report to OIE where the bird was identified as a mallard. A Mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) found dead in the same area on December 30 also tested positive for H5N1.
