Macao (H7)
On June 22, the Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau suspended live poultry trade for three days in Macao after samples have tested positive for an H7 avian influenza virus at the Iao Hon Market in the Portuguese Territories. They culled 8,000 chickens and 1,000 pigeons from the market. Control measures implemented were inspection and disinfection of the slaughterhouses and markets. The cause of the outbreak is unknown. This is the second suspension of live poultry trade this year in Macao. In February, the live poultry trade suspended poultry sales for three days due to an H7 avian influenza virus strain detected in poultry at a different market.
