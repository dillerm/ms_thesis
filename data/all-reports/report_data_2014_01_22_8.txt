Avian Influenza in Humans in China (LPAI H7N9)
 The Shanghai Municipal Commission of Health and Family Planning reported on January 20 that a medial worker at a Shanghai hospital died of H7N9, escalating the concern that avian influenza may be transmittable from person-to-person.  The victim, a 31-year-old man, died on January 18.  Shanghai has confirmed seven avian influenza cases so far this year and officials are worried that the number may rise during the upcoming Chinese New Year celebration.  Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization said “It’s always a concern when health workers die. Hospitals and other medical facilities are a flash point for human-to-human transmission. We would be very much wanting to follow up in as much detail as possible on this case.”
