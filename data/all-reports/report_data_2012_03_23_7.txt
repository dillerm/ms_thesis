H5N1 in Poultry in India
On March 10, official sources confirmed a recent outbreak of H5N1 bird flu at a government-run poultry farm in Tripura. “We have decided to begin culling after confirmation of the presence of H5N1 virus in the affected birds by High Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL) in Bhopal last night”, Director of the Animal Resource Development Department, Monaranjan Sarkar said. In the weeks prior to testing, the number of chicks on the farm had dropped from 3,871 to 30. Sarkar added that all necessary precautionary measures have been taken to contain the outbreak and that rapid response teams have been asked to start culling birds on the farm.
