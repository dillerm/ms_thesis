Avian Influenza in Humans in China (LPAI H7N9).
Chinese health officials confirmed two new outbreaks of H7N9 on February 26. The victims, a 65-year-old woman from Guangzhou and a two-year-old girl from Zhejiang, have both been hospitalized and the 65-year-old woman is in critical condition. Since October, 237 illnesses have been detected bringing the total number of human H7N9 cases in China to 373. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control as well as the Public Health Agency of Canada are conducting risk assessments and have reported that “the virus doesn't spread easily among people, though limited person-to-person transmission may occur when there is close contact, the update noted. The H7N9 virus bears close watching, though, because less severe cases have been seen in influenza-like illness surveillance, and the PHAC said it expects more cases to be reported as the flu season progresses.”
