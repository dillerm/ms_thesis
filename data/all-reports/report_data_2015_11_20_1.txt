Hong Kong (HPAI H5)
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) in Hong Kong has reported that preliminary tests on an Oriental magpie-robin have come back positive for highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus.  Confirmatory tests are being conducted.  The bird, a common species resident to the area, was found dead in a staircase of an apartment building in the New Territories region where there are no poultry farms nearby. To prevent further spread of the disease, a range of precautionary measures are being implemented, including increased inspections of poultry farms and markets, educating bird shop owners and racing pigeon enthusiasts, and stopping the illegal importation of birds.
