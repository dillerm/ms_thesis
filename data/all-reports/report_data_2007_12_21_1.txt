H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
A grey heron (Ardea cinerea) found sick on December 5 at a wetland near the Mai Po Nature Reserve that subsequently died has tested positive for H5N1, which prompted authorities to temporarily close public access to the reserve. Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said the reserve will be closed for 21 days. The grey heron is a non-native species and migrates to Hong Kong in winter. In another occurrence, a common buzzard (a common visitor to Hong Kong) found dead on December 17 in Lantau has tested positive for H5N1. According to the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department, there are no chicken farms within 3 km of where the birds were found at either location.
