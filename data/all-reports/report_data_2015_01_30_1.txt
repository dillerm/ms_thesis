According to Dr. Pencho Kamenov, head of the Healthcare of Animals, a Dalmatian pelican (Pelacanus crispus) found dead in the Poda Protected Area near Burgas which is located on the Black Sea tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus.  A black-headed gull carcass found at the same time has tested negative for avian influenza. Control measures have been taken along the entire Black Sea coast, including a ban on hunting and markets.  Movement and bio security measures have also been placed at certain sites.  The Dalmatian pelican is a new species record for infection with HPAI H5N1.
