The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports new cases of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus in the Ã…land islands and the southwestern archipelago. A total of 9 peacocks in a zoo died of the disease, and the remaining 28 birds in the group were culled to prevent further spread. Wild tufted ducks were also found to have died of the disease in the southwestern archipelago. In addition to culling, other control measures implemented include: movement control; screening; traceability; stamping out; surveillance; disinfection and disinfestation; and official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste. The source of this outbreak is unknown.
