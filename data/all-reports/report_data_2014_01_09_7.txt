Hong Kong (H7N9)
 Hong Kong health officials confirmed that an 80-year-old man died after contracting the H7N9 virus. The man, who lived in Shenzhen's Bao An District, tested positive for the virus on December 6 and remained in the hospital until his death on December 26.  While the source of the outbreak has not been confirmed, “his family was said to have prepared live chicken in their Shenzhen home.”  This is the country’s second H7N9 outbreak this month.  The first victim, a 36-year-old woman, is currently in stable condition.  Hong Kong officials have increased border control to prevent further outbreaks.
