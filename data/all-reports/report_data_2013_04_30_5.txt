H7N9 in Humans in Taiwan
 Health officials in Taiwan confirmed on April 24, 2013, that a 53-year-old man has contracted H7N9, the new and dangerous strain of avian influenza.  This is the first case of H7N9 outside of mainland China, where 108 cases and 22 deaths have been reported.  The patient is extremely ill and is being treated in an isolation room.  The 139 people who had contact with him are also being closely monitored.  The patient, who frequently traveled between China and Taiwan, said he had not been exposed to poultry or uncooked poultry or eggs, making scientists wonder just how the virus is spread.Officials in neighboring countries remain on high alert now that the virus has left the mainland.  Japan and Hong Kong are making sure their safety measures are up-to-date to ensure they will be ready if the virus spreads.While there are still many unknowns about the H7N9 virus, Nancy Cox, the director of the influenza division at Centers for Disease Control, reported that the number of “new cases in Shanghai has seen a dramatic slowdown”, and that “the reduction in frequency of new cases is very encouraging".
