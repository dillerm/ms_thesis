H5N1 in Wild birds in South Korea
A house cat that died in Gimje along the Mangyeong River is being tested for bird flu. H5N1 was detected in the Gimje area in April of this year, though no outbreaks have been reported since May 12. It is unknown whether the cat died recently or at the time of the last outbreak, but Dr. Kim Chul-joong from the Chungnam National University said, "We (have) isolated the highly pathogenic strain of avian flu from the dead cat found along the Mangyeong River in Gimje," and has asked the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service to confirm the result. An article in the local newspaper, the Chosun, said that if the death is confirmed, the authorities may order a cull of cats, dogs and wild animals. South Korea will begin year-round monitoring for bird flu, using 23 teams around the country to monitor resident and migratory birds. Poultry farms will also be inspected every two weeks with special attention to the 2,384 duck farms - the type of bird responsible for the most serious bird flu outbreaks. "Because of this decision, the government will require even small duck farms to be registered so they can be checked," said Lee Sang-Kil, head of the ministry's livestock policy bureau. South Korea had been hoping to declare itself free from avian influenza in August if no new cases were reported.
