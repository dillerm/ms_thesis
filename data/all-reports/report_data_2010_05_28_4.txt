The birds began to show clinical signs on April 27. Presence of the virus was confirmed by testing at the National Animal Health Centre. Control measures such as movement control, screening, zoning, and disinfection of the premises have been undertaken. Active and passive surveillance are ongoing within a 5km radius of the farm.
