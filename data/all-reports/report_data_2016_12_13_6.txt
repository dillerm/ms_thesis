Hong Kong (HPAI H5N6)
The Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department (AFCD) reports that a total of 4 fecal samples have tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus at the Mai Po Nature Reserve. The samples were collected at a “gei wai”, a traditional shrimp cultivation system over a span of five days. The initial set of three samples were identified as being from northern pintails. This is the first detection of HPAI H5N6 in Hong Kong since last February. Cleaning and disinfection have taken place, and the AFCD warns people to maintain good personal hygiene and avoid contact with wild birds.
