Canada (LPAI H5N2)
The BC Poultry Association in Canada has reported a case of low pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus in a wild duck shot by a hunter. The case in Fraser Valley was detected by a random test by the province of British Columbia. The source of the outbreak is unknown, and although the risk to farm flock is low, experts are urging poultry farms to implement extra biosecurity measures. Precautions suggested include movement control, and making sure that workers change outerwear and footwear when entering and exiting barns.
