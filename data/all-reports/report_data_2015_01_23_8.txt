Taiwan (HPAI H5N3)
According to the Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine, birds on 370 goose, duck, and chicken farms in northern, central and southern parts of Taiwan have been confirmed with the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of subtypes H5N2, H5N3, or H5N8.  The H5N3 strain found at 17 goose farms in Kaohsiung and Pingung is new to the country, and was discovered through DNA testing to be a hybrid of a N3 strain responsible for outbreaks in Kaohsiung, Taiwan last year, and an H5 strain responsible for outbreaks in South Korea last year.  The H5N2 strain has so far only been found in Taiwan and was discovered through DNA testing to be a hybrid of a H5N2 strain that was responsible of outbreaks in poultry in South Korea last year and China in 2011.  The viruses are believed to have been carried to Taiwan by migratory birds.  Over half million poultry have been culled, and health authorities ordered all poultry slaughter houses to cease operations for two days to carry out sterilization.  Other control measures include testing of poultry within in a 3-kilometer radius of the affected farms and movement restrictions across the island.
