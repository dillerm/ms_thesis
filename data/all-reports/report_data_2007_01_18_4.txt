H5N1 in Humans
China reported its first H5N1 case in almost six months: a 37-year-old farmer from the eastern province of Anhui who kept backyard chickens. He developed symptoms on December 10, 2006, was admitted to the hospital on December 17, and was discharged on January 6, 2007, having fully recovered.  An initial test for H5N1 was negative, but H5N1 was detected on a second test and the results were immediately shared with the WHO.  Henk Bekedam, WHO’s China representative, noted that while there were no known H5N1 outbreaks in poultry where the man lived, it was possible for the farmer’s birds to be infected with H5N1 and not show any symptoms because improvements in poultry vaccination rates in China could make it more difficult for authorities to detect a circulating virus. China’s last reported human case was from July 2006 in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the northwest.
