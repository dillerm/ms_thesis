Avian Influenza in Humans in Cambodia (H5N1)
The Cambodian Ministry of Health reported on October 31 a confirmed case of the H5N1 virus in the Battambang province. This is Cambodia’s 22nd H5N1 case in 2013. Cambodia has had 43 total confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus, with 32 of the cases having been children under 14 years of age. Of the 22 recent cases, 11 resulted in fatalities. The most recent case, a 6-year-old girl from Romdoul village in the Phnom Preuk district, is currently in stable condition; an ongoing investigation into the case found reports of recent chicken and duck deaths in the girl’s neighborhood and nearby villages. Officials hope that further investigation will provide more information about exactly how exposure of the virus occurred. A nationwide public health education campaign was recently launched; officials are specifically warning against the common practice of children handling poultry.
