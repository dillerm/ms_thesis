Mexico (HPAI H7N3)
According to a report from the OIE on May 8, five outbreaks of H7N3 bird flu in Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Puebla states have killed 40,019 birds and another 850,005 have been culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Two of the outbreaks were in Jalisco; one began on March 1 in a 16 bird backyard-flock and one began on April 29 at a commercial layer farm of 320,000 birds. Guanajuato had two outbreaks; one in a heavy breeder flock and one on a fattening farm. A total of 419,999 birds were culled on the two farms in Guanajuato. The most recent outbreak was in Puebla. It began on May 1 and was resolved on May 7 after 40,000 poultry had died from the virus and 110,000 were culled. In early April, Mexican authorities reported that recent H7N3 outbreaks had destroyed almost 4 million poultry and cost farmers about $32 million. The annual ANECA convention, the Mexican Association of Poultry Science Specialist, held at the end of April, discussed the rapid spread of H7N3 bird flu across central Mexico. One problem faced by authorities is that while OIE and Mexican officials report that the disease is contained within one area of the country, the industry believes that it has spread across the entire nation. During the meeting an official announced the outbreak in Puebla, an outbreak that confirms the expansion of the disease beyond central Mexico, though several areas in between have not had official reports of the disease. In late April the virus was reported in backyard-flocks the state of Tlaxcala, a halfway point between the Jalisco and Puebla outbreaks. Problems that may have contributed to the spread of the disease include lack of action by the government and poor industry practices (lack of biosecurity, sale of untreated poultry litter to other farms, sale of live spent hens, and a high number of live sales). Currently vaccination is the only control strategy, but the efficacy of the vaccine is being questioned.
