H5N1 in Poultry in India
A rural backyard poultry farm in the Khordha district of Odisha lost three birds to the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus, H5N1, on January 3. Of the 35,389 susceptible birds, an additional 31,912 were destroyed. The disease was confirmed at the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal, but the cause remains unknown. Stamping out of all domestic poultry is being applied in an approximately 3-km radius zone around the outbreak. An intensive surveillance campaign has been launched in a 10-km radius zone including: closure of poultry markets and prohibition on the sale and transportation of poultry products in the infected zone, and disinfection of premises after culling and sealing of premises where appropriate. Restocking will be applied in accordance with a specified protocol.
