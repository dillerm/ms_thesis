H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 12-year-old boy from South Bali died of H5N1 bird flu on February 21. The child developed symptoms on February 11, was admitted to a private clinic on February 16, and was transferred to the Bird Flu Unit at Sanglah Hospital only 5 hours prior to death. Dr. Ken Wirasandshi, the head of the Bird Flu Team at Sanglah Hospital, said that the patient was suffering from respiratory distress and laboratory tests confirmed bird flu virus. Epidemiological investigation into the source of infection indicated contact with poultry, though no poultry deaths within the household or neighborhood have been reported. The childâ€™s parents, however, deny any contact with poultry prior to the onset of the disease.
