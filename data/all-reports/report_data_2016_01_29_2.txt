Ivory Coast (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports a new case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in chickens at a poultry market in Abidjan. After 3 chickens died, the National Laboratory for Agricultural Development confirmed avian influenza as the cause. The remaining 1,997 susceptible birds were not culled. Instead, control measures including movement control, screening, disinfection, spraying, quarantine, and stamping out, were implemented. The cause of the outbreak is unknown, but the animals in transit did have contact with wild birds.
