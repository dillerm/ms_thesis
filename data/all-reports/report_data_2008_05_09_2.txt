H5N1 in Poultry in South Korea
Bird flu is suspected at a small farm in the industrial city of Daegu (Taegu), in the eastern province of Gyeongsang. This is the second suspected outbreak in the province within one week. Samples from dead birds from the farm have tested positive for H5N1,the Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries. The virus has now been found in six of the country’s nine provinces. Only Gangwean, Jeju, and North Chungcheong remain unaffected.Bird flu has been detected near a children’s park located in the Gwanglin District Office in Seoul. The Ministry for Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries said tests conducted on four birds have detected H5N1. If confirmed, this would be the first time that H5N1 has spread to the capital. The local government unknowingly purchased two infected pheasants for an aviary from a farm market at Seongnam, south of Seoul, that infected two other birds before dying. The aviary, located 1.2 km from the children's park, had 57 birds including chickens, ducks, pheasants, and turkeys;  birds began dying in late April. All birds have since been destroyed and another 221 destroyed at the childrens’s park. Investigators examined a pheasant dealer’s shop in Seongnam, Gyeonggi Province, and a suspected poultry farm in Seoul as possible sources of the origin of the Gwanglin virus, but all samples were negative. Wild birds from a lake on Konkuk University campus, located less than 500 m from the aviary, have been captured for testing.
