H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 5-month-old boy from Karawang regency died at Hasan Sadikin Hospital on December 3. Doctors suspect that pandemic H1N1 2009 may have been the cause. The baby had shown symptoms such as a high fever and respiratory trouble since November 25 and it is not known whether he had contact with animals. After hospitalization the baby was treated with antibiotics and placed on a ventilator. Initial tests were negative for both H1N1 and H5N1, but people are still concerned because pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus has been spreading rapidly in the area.
