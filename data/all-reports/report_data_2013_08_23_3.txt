Cambodia (H5N1)
The World Health Organization (WHO) reported the death of a nine-year-old boy in Battambang province from the H5N1 virus earlier this month. Before he fell ill last month, the boy carried sick and dead chickens and ducks to be prepared as food by his sister. The WHO suspects that a probable reason for the virus’s spread is the unregulated and informal transportation on motorbikes of poultry between villages. Subsequent investigation by the Ministry of Animal Health and Production found dead poultry in the boy’s village and H5N1 has been confirmed in some of the animals. This recent death raises the total fatalities in the country this year to ten. A total of 37 human cases, all but eight of which proved fatal, have been recorded since 2003.
