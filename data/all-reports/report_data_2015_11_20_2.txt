Cambodia (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported two more cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in ducks in backyard flocks in the Battambang and Siem Reap provinces.  The virus was discovered when the flock owners reported sick and dying birds.  A total of 2,280 birds have died out of 8,000.  To prevent further spread of the disease movement control, disinfection and dipping/spraying measures were taken.  The remaining birds were not culled.  The source of the outbreak is unknown. The Phnom Penh Post is reporting the impact the avian influenza outbreaks in Battambang and Siem Reap is having on poultry related businesses.  According to the paper, poultry farmers are concerned for their livelihoods as the government doesn't compensate them for outbreak related losses.  Poultry wholesalers are worried about a decreased availability of birds and a decrease in demand from consumers fearful of catching the disease.  Some restaurants are dependent on popular demand, such as those that specialize in duck dishes, like Muscovy soup.
