H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
 The Nepalese District Livestock Services Office confirmed earlier this week that four poultry farms around the country have been affected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus.  In the Lalitpur and Chitwan Districts, in total, about 1,700 birds and 5 ducks were culled and chicken feed was destroyed to help prevent the disease from spreading further.Officials are keeping a close eye on the growing number of affected farms in the country due to the growing number of avian influenza cases occurring in the summer months.  Historically, the virus was only seen in the winter months, but this year has started to survive in higher temperatures.  Nepalese health officials continue to urge the public to take necessary safety precautions when cooking, eating, and coming in contact with poultry.
