South Korea (HPAI H5N8)
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza has been confirmed in one of three dogs at an affected duck farm in southeastern South Korea.  It is believed the dog may have consumed infected ducks.  No antigens or antibodies were found in the other two dogs, suggesting no dog-to-dog transmission of the virus.  All three dogs have been culled.
