Finland (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 on the island of Vårdö in southwestern Finland. This is the first record of this strain in Finland.  On November 12, approximately 60 tufted ducks were found dead in different places in the Åland archipelago. Four birds have been submitted for testing, and two birds have tested positive for HPAI H5N8.  Control measures include movement control inside the country, screening, and surveillance within containment and/or protection zones.  Vaccination is prohibited.  Testing was conducted by the Finnish Food Safety Authority (Evira) in Helsinki.
