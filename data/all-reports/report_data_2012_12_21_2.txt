H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
 Beginning on December 13, about 3,000 chickens have died over the course of a week at a poultry farm in Dharke of Dhading district, Bagmati Zone in Nepal. The Central Animal Disease Investigation Laboratory confirmed the deaths were due to avian influenza. On December 20, a Rapid Response Team reached the infected poultry farm to conduct cleaning, disinfection, and the disposal of affected poultry products, such as manure, eggs and feed, to stop the disease from spreading.  Another team is in charge of surveillance of nearby farms, watching for bird flu symptoms. Earlier in the week, farmers in the same town of Dharke had seized two trucks carrying frozen chicken destined for Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurants in Nepal over concerns of illegal importation of chicken from India.
