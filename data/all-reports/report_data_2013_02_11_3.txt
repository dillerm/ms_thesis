H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
The National Steering Committee for Bird Flu Control reported outbreaks of H5N1 at a meeting earlier this week. Two poultry farms in Ben Cau District and Tay Ninh Town were found to be the sources of the outbreak resulting in the death and culling of about 3,500 birds. The farms are located across the border from Cambodia where several human H5N1 cases were reported last month. The Vietnamese public security force, along with veterinary service personnel, are closely monitoring poultry coming in and out of the country due to the recent human deaths in neighboring Cambodia and the upcoming lunar New Year where large amounts of chicken meat will be consumed.
