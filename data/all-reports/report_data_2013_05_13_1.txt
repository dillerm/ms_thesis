China (LPAI H7N9)
 The Ministry of Agriculture announced on May 9 that an environmental sample from a poultry market in Fujian Province tested positive for H7N9 bird flu. That brings the total number of samples that have tested positive for this strain of the virus to 52 in China. The ministry has ordered the local government to properly dispose of the sample and increase monitoring and prevention work. The virus has killed 33 people since it was first detected in Shanghai in March 2013. Three outbreaks of low pathogenic H7N9 bird flu began around April 4 in the Guangdong, Jiangxi, and Shandong Provinces. The outbreaks in Guangdong and Jiangxi were discovered in one chicken in each province, and the outbreak in Shandong was discovered in three environmental samples. None of the chickens had died from the disease, but 89,864 birds in Guangdong province were culled as a precautionary measure. Tests at the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute showed that the samples were positive for H7N9 bird flu. Measures applied so far include control of wildlife reservoirs, quarantine, movement control, screening, zoning, disinfection of infected premises, and dipping/spraying. There are plans to cull more birds to prevent the disease from spreading. The source of the outbreaks is unknown.
