H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
The government announced on March 12 that four villages in Sunsari and Jhapa districts are experiencing H5N1 bird flu outbreaks. A cabinet meeting that day decided to send immediate relief to the four villages and take measures to prevent the disease from spreading. Outbreaks in three of these villages (2 in Jhapa and 1 in Sunsari) have been reported to OIE. A total of 326 birds out of 468 housed in these villages died from the virus and the remaining 142 were culled. Tests were conducted by the Central Veterinary Laboratory and results were positive for H5N1 bird flu, but the source of the outbreaks is unknown. The infected areas have already been cleaned, disinfected, and sealed. The carcasses of the birds have been destroyed. Post-operative surveillance activities are being intensively carried out throughout the country. Other control measures undertaken include quarantine, movement control, screening and dipping/spraying.
