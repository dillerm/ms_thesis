H7N9 in Mammals
Researchers in China and North America completed their initial assessments of how quickly the H7N9 virus can spread between ferrets and pigs.  They discovered the new bird flu virus passes easily between ferrets sharing the same cage by direct contact, which is troublesome; but, they also found that it does not travel well through airborne secretions such as coughing and sneezing.  The results were similar with pigs.  Infected pigs did not spread the virus easily, either through direct contact or through airborne secretions. And while this data offers scientists a little hope, other recent data does the opposite.  Scientists in China recently found tiny mutations on two H7N9 viruses which suggest that the virus might be evolving.  Dr. Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital said that it is of the utmost importance to try to get this virus out of the animal populations. "On a scale from 1 to 10 — from an avian virus with no potential to infect humans to a fully human-adapted strain — we don't know exactly where this H7N9 is," Webby says. "But I think we can safely say from these data that it might be closer to 10 than the avian viruses we've seen infecting humans in the last decade."
