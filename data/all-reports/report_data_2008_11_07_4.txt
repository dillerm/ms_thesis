H5N1 in Poultry in Thailand
Livestock officials have reported the suspected discovery of H5N1 in chickens in a village in Sukhothai province. Deaths of chickens in the village went unreported at first, said assistant village chief Jamnien Puengwang, because villagers were afraid their fighting birds would be destroyed. The first deaths occurred on October 10th when five of 14 chickens died in a single household, according to the Thai Department of Livestock Development, which then implemented stamping out and disinfection procedures. Over 5,500 birds have been culled and 200 cloacal swabs collected from 50 villages in the surrounding area. So far, none of the samples have tested positive for HPAI so far.
