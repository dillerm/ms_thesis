Hong Kong (possible H7N9)
 Officials reported on February 17 that thirteen birds were found dead on the pavement in the Hong Kong region of New Territories.  Photos in the local media suggest that all 13 were red-whiskered bulbuls. The birds are being examined to see if H7N9 was a factor in their deaths, although this virus is not known to be pathogenic to birds.  This news comes after poultry markets on the mainland have been closed in Guangzhou and Shenzhen to prevent further spread of the virus.  A spokesperson from the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society believes “there is no direct connection between the death of birds and H7N9.  Red-whiskered bulbuls do not move among poultry or eat their food so there is little chance they would be affected with H7N9.”  Lab results should be available within the next couple of days.
