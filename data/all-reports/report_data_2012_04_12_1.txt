H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
An oriental magpie robin (Copsychus saularis) found dead in Hung Hom tested positive for H5 bird flu. The Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department reported that there are no poultry farms within 3-km of where it was found on April 4. The department has stepped up cleansing and disinfection of nearby venues, and issued advisories to poultry farmers, pet shops, and license holders of pet poultry and racing pigeons.
