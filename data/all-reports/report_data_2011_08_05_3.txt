H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
 In the Banteay Meanchey Province of Cambodia, a 4-year-old girl contracted H5N1 bird flu last month after a local village outbreak of H5N1 bird flu.  She was reported to have had exposure to dead poultry and died on July 20 from complications of the disease.  She is the 17th person in Cambodia to be infected with H5N1 bird flu and the 15th to die from the disease.  The National and local Rapid Response Teams are conducting an investigation of the outbreak.  Thirteen contacts in the affected village were tested for A/H5N1 bird flu all with negative results.  The local health center and hospital will continue to monitor for influenza-like illness and severe acute respiratory infections for two weeks.
