HPAI H7N3 in Poultry in Mexico
Officials from the Servicio Nacional de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria (SENASICA) reported that over the past month, eight H7N3 outbreaks have been confirmed in four Mexican states: Jalisco, Puebla, Guanajuato, and Aguascalientes. In total, the affected poultry farms, including two commercial layer farms, two heavy breeder flocks, three broiler flocks, and a backyard farm, have culled 815,034 birds. The remaining 296,054 birds are being closely monitored and vaccinated to prevent the disease from spreading further. Additional control measures being applied include movement control, screening and zoning, and disinfection of contaminated areas.
