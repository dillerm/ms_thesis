H5N1 in Wild birds in Philippines
Fishermen in Pangasinan are fearful that migrating egrets will decimate their harvests or bring bird flu to the area. Dukakak, the local name for egrets, fly from China to the Philippines each year and can eat up to six bangus, or milkfish, a day.  Fishermen use firecrackers and nylon wires to protect their fish from the birds that number in the thousands. The provincial veterinarian, Benedicto Perez, also worries about the birds bringing bird flu to the area. However, the Department of Agriculture has been testing birds in 34 provinces since January and all samples have so far been negative and the Philippines is one of only two countries in the area to remain unaffected by H5N1.
