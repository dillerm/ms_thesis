India (H5N1)
Officials from the Animal Resource Development Department (ARDD) have reported a case of H5N1 avian influenza virus in chickens and ducks at a government poultry farm at Gandhigram. Samples were taken after suspicious deaths were observed; avian influenza was confirmed by a laboratory in Bhopal. To prevent any spread of the disease, over 8,500 birds were culled and 10,500 eggs destroyed. As a further precaution, officials have plans to cull poultry within a 1 km radius in the near future. The cause of this outbreak is unreported.
