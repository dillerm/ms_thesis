Japan (HPAI H5)
Japanese health officials confirmed an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza earlier this week at a poultry farm in the Kumamoto prefecture. To prevent the disease from spreading, 168,000 chickens were culled. Additionally, authorities have been sanitizing areas around the two contaminated farms, disinfecting vehicles that come in and out of the region, and are testing birds at nearby farms to ensure the disease has not spread. This is the first case of avian influenza in Japan in three years.
