While recently identified HPAI H5 highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (H5N2, H5N8, and H5N1) are not known to have caused disease in humans, their appearance in North American birds may increase the likelihood of human infection in the United States.  Other avian influenza viruses have been associated with severe, sometimes fatal, disease, with infections most often occurring through unprotected contact with infected birds or contaminated surfaces.  Although the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) considers the risk to the general public from newly-identified HPAI H5 viruses to be low, they recommend the following precautions: clinicians should consider the possibility of HPAI H5 infection in patient showing symptoms of respiratory illness and who have a history of exposure; state health departments should investigate potential human cases of HPAI H5 virus infection and notify CDC; people should avoid unprotected exposure to sick or dead birds, feces, litter, or contaminated materials; and people exposed to birds infected HPAI H5 should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection for 10 days.  No human vaccines are currently available for the viruses in the United States.
