H5N1 in Poultry in India
Despite an increase from 14,000 to 23,000 in the number of birds culled, the bird flu outbreak in North Dinajpur continues to spread. Residents in the villages of the Hemtabad block fear that even after culling and disinfection operations, there are still around 3,000 birds in the area. Allegedly the North Dinajpur animal husbandry department has not responded to the crisis since the initial culling. Reports say that ten to fifteen birds die of bird flu every day. Villagers are concerned that the culling teams did not check the houses of the village intensively during their visit and they have reported the problem to the animal husbandry department, but have not yet gotten a response. The animal husbandry department declined to comment but the North Dinajpur district manager said, â€œThe continuing presence of infected birds in such villages has been reported to us. After visiting the villages we will instruct the concerned department to take needful action immediately."
