Ghana (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in the Greater Accra region of southern Ghana.  The outbreaks occurred on October 24 and 26.  Both cases involved flocks of several hundred layers kept in deep litter; approximately 50% of the birds died, and the rest were destroyed.  This is the final report of this disease in Ghana, indicating that authorities believe there will be no more outbreaks for the foreseeable future.
