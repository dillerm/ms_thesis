Avian Influenza in Animals in USA (Eurasian H5)
The United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA APHIS) has confirmed a case of H5 avian influenza virus in a wild mallard duck shot by a hunter in Oregon. Because of the low amount of genetic material available in the sample, tests were only able to confirm that it was Eurasian H5, but not the specific strain of the virus, nor whether it was low pathogenic or highly pathogenic. As part of their avian monitoring program, APHIS plans to sample more than 40,000 wild birds by July 1, 2016, 24,000 of which have already been sampled. The United States has been declared free of highly pathogenic avian influenza since November 18, and the USDA urges anyone involved in any form of poultry production to improve their biosecurity measures, and prevent any contact between their animals and wild birds.
