H5N1 in Poultry in Germany
Low-pathogenic H5N2 was detected on a poultry farm in Mecklenburg-West Pommerania during a routine visit from officials. On November 12, the Ministry of Agriculture ordered the culling of 17,000 ducks and geese for fear that the disease might mutate into high pathogenic bird flu. Bird flu was last reported in Germany in 2006.
