H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
 A new H5N1 avian flu virus (clade 2.3.2.1c) is spreading rapidly across northern and central Vietnam.  As of September 6, 2012, seven provinces have bird flu epidemics and more than 180,000 poultry have been culled.  The source of these outbreaks is inconclusive, although the vice president of the Vietnam Animal Husbandry Agency, Nguyen Thanh Son, believes chickens illegally imported from China were the source of the virus.  Control measures applied include quarantine, movement control, disinfection, and strict regulation of the import of breeding chickens from China; while control measures yet to be applied include screening and zoning to monitor any possible future outbreaks and vaccination in response to the outbreaks.  Experts say that the new avian flu virus developed in July and spread to the northern and central regions of Vietnam in August.  The Central Veterinary Diagnosis Center will start testing the current vaccine against the new virus within the next couple of days.
