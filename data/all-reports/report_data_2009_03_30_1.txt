H5N1 in Poultry in France
Officials have reported two outbreaks of low pathogenic avian influenza. Two captive ducks (decoys) used for luring wild ducks into a hunting area tested positive for LPAI H5N1. These two were from a group of ten that were tested from a premises housing 45 ducks in Calvados. Additionally, two other decoy ducks from a site in Pas-de Calais (where 563 ducks are kept) tested positive for H5 (not N1) during routine testing. Both sites have been placed under surveillance and have increased biosecurity, but affected birds were not culled.
