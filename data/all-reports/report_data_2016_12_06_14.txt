Netherlands (HPAI H5N8)
Four outbreaks of H5N8 have been reported in The Netherlands.  On November 11, HPAI was detected in two dead birds from a hobby flock of black swans in Den Oever, North Holland.  The remainder of the flock was culled, and in total 34 black swans and a wild duck died or were destroyed.  This incident has not triggered any control measures beyond the culling.  During the period of November 26 to December 1, three duck farms in Biddinghuizen, Flevoland Province experienced HPAI H5N8 mortality events.  All susceptible birds at those farms have been culled; in addition, the ducks kept at several farms owned by the same company as one of the affected farms have been culled as a precautionary measure.  Farms near the affected farms have been screened and found negative for AI.  Additional control measures include movement control inside the country, screening, disinfection/disinfestation, stamping out, control of wildlife reservoirs, and zoning.
