USA (HPAI H7N8)
The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) report a new case of highly pathogenic H7N8 avian influenza virus in a commercial turkey flock in Dubois County, Indiana. Suspicious mortality events were observed at the farm, and were confirmed by National Veterinary Services Laboratories to be a result of a North American strain of avian influenza. A total of 900 turkeys died of the disease, and the remaining 42,600 were culled to prevent further spread of the virus. In addition to culling, further control measures include movement control, quarantine, heightened surveillance, stamping out, and zoning. Disinfection and disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste will be implemented after necessary testing is finished. APHIS urges anyone involved with poultry to review their biosecurity measures, the cause of this outbreak is unknown.
