H5N1 in wild birds in India
The mysterious deaths of some animals and birds at the Sepahijala Zoo over the past week have put authorities on alert after the detection of H5N1 bird flu at two government-run farms in western Tripura. Three leopards, one wild cat and 13 birds, including some extremely endangered species, have been found dead in the zoo’s enclosures. The Director of Sepahijala Zoo and head of the wildlife sanctuary, Ajit Bhowmik, said on March 13, “We have sent samples to state and national level laboratories” and that “no indication of avian influenza or swine influenza has been found.”  He added that “the disease might have been caused by some viral infection. We have taken preventive measures for the other animals and birds in the zoo.”  The Tripura government has since culled more than 16,000 ducks and poultry birds, and destroyed thousands of eggs and feeding material at both of the affected farms.
