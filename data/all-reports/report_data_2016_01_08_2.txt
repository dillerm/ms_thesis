France (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has reported additional cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in the Dordogne and Lot Departments. The National Reference Laboratory confirmed the presence of the H5N1 virus from samples taken from 45 hens and guinea fowls which were found dead on farms in Celles, Dordogne and in Miers, Lot. A total of 1450 birds remaining on the farms were deemed susceptible, and all are scheduled to be culled to prevent further spread of the disease. Lot is the 7th Department to be affected by a case of avian influenza. All departments have been in the southwestern region of France. The most recent outbreak, the 67th case of highly pathogenic avian influenza in France, comes from Gabat, in the Pyrénées Atlantiques Department. In addition to culling, the following measures were taken: movement control; screening; disinfection; traceability; zoning; stamping out; disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste; and control of wildlife reservoirs. The source of these outbreaks is unknown.
