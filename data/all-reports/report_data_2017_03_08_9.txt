A total of 6 cases were confirmed and an additional 12,806 susceptible birds were culled. The source of the outbreak is unknown and poor farm biosecurity is a concern in the region. Control measures in place include movement control inside the country, disinfection, quarantine, and official destruction or disposal of animal products, carcasses, by-products, and waste. Vaccination is prohibited. Over a hundred farms have been affected since H5N1 reappeated in Nigeria in 2014.
