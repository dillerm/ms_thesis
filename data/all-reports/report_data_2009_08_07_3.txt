H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 17-year-old girl was admitted to the Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital in South Sulawesi on July 31 with a suspected H5N1 infection. She is exhibiting symptoms such as fever, cough, nausea, and suffocation. She became ill after a number of chickens around her home died suddenly. The girl is now receiving treatment in an isolation room. A government team has been assigned to conduct surveillance in the girlâ€™s neighborhood as part of an effort to prevent the virus from spreading. Over 100 people in Indonesia have died from H5N1 since the disease first emerged.
