H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
 The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed two new human cases of H5N1 in Cambodia, bringing the number of human deaths to five since the start of the year.  The most recent victims, a 17-month-old girl and a nine-year-old girl, from the southern provinces of Kampong Speu and Kampot, both died after contracting the deadly virus.  The Cambodian Health Minister is urging parents to keep children away from dead or ill poultry and to wash their hands often.  Cambodia has been hit especially hard with bird flu over the years with a total of 26 deaths, 17 of them in children under the age of 14.
