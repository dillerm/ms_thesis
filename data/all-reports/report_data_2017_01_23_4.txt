France (HPAI H5N8)
On January 4, the French Ministry of Agriculture ordered a cull of nearly all healthy, outdoor-reared ducks and geese in Gers, Landes, and Haute-Pyrenees, the three departments which have been most severely affected by H5N8 this season.  On January 17, this order was expanded to include 45 additional municipalities outside of those departments.  The country had experienced 136 farm outbreaks and 9 wildlife detections as of January 17.
