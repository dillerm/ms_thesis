H7N9 in Poultry and Humans in China
 As of April 18, 2013, there have been 87 confirmed cases of H7N9 in four provinces (Anhui, Henan, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang) and two municipalities (Shanghai and Beijing) in eastern China, resulting in 17 deaths and many unanswered questions.  Scientists still do not know how people get infected, as 40% of the people who have gotten sick did not come in close contact with birds. Additionally, scientists cannot pin-point what exactly is fueling this outbreak.  It could be birds, other animals, human-to-human transmission, or even from contaminated dust at open markets.  Uncovering where the virus comes from and how it spreads is the World Health Organizations (WHO’s) top priority.China also announced late this week that they are going to look into the possibility of human-to-human transmission by specifically looking at “family clusters” of people infected with the virus.  They are currently studying a family of two brothers and their father who recently died of the virus and the two infected children from Beijing.  Health officials are also continuing their research to see if the victims of H7N9 did or did not come in contact with poultry. As the mystery of this virus continues, the WHO said there was ‘no evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission, but a team of influenza experts have been invited to China to advise on the investigation.
