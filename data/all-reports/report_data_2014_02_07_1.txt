South Korea (HPAI H5N8)
 South Korean farm ministry officials announced that the country has culled two percent of its domestic poultry population, or 2.8 million birds, since the deadly virus H5N8 was first discovered January 17.  To date, 15 poultry farms have confirmed outbreaks and 19 cases of the virus have been verified in migratory birds.  In hopes to prevent further outbreaks, South Korea is increasing disinfection measures for migratory birds and limiting the movement of livestock workers in the affected provinces. Because of the recent outbreaks, poultry sales have dropped substantially, adding yet another strain on the farmers.  South Korea has had four bird flu outbreaks in the past 10 years; none of them have occurred in humans.
