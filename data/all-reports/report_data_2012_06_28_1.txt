H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) reported on June 20 that a scaly-breasted munia (Lonchura punctulata) found dead in Yuen Long on June 18 has been confirmed to be positive for H5N1 bird flu. Cleansing and disinfection have been stepped up in the area and three chicken farms within 3 km of the find site were inspected. No signs of abnormal mortality or symptoms of bird flu were discovered on the farms, but they will be kept under enhanced surveillance as a precaution. The AFCD is encouraging all poultry farmers, bird shop owners, and license holders of pet poultry to strengthen precautionary and biosecurity measures against avian influenza. The department will continue monitoring and surveillance of wild birds. The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) remains vigilant in inspections of imported live poultry and live poultry stalls. The Department of Health continues to educate the public and remind them to maintain strict personal and environmental hygiene to prevent bird flu.  The AFCD, FEHD, and the Customs and Excise Department are working together to deter the illegal import of poultry and birds into Hong Kong to ensure that all birds go through proper inspection and quarantine and to minimize the risk of bird flu.
