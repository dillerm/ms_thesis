H5N1 in Poultry in China
According to a Chinese source, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has ruled in favor of China in its dispute with the United States over an effective U.S. ban on imports of cooked chicken from China. The dispute had its origins in health concerns following outbreaks of bird flu in China. A spending bill was passed in the U.S. Congress that prevented the authorities from taking any measures to process imports of Chinese chicken. China said that the measure was discriminatory because their chicken met international health standards. The U.S. ended the ban when the WTO panel was set up in July 2009, but the ban has remained effectively in place while the U.S. Department of Agriculture is reviewing Chinese food safety rules before deciding whether it can start inspections at Chinese processing plants. China is now the third biggest market for U.S. farm goods, but China has imposed duties on U.S. chicken products that it said were being dumped in the Chinese market or unfairly subsidized. The WTO issued a ruling in the dispute to the two parties on Monday, but it remains confidential until it is published in a few months time. There was no official comment from Chinese or U.S. authorities.
