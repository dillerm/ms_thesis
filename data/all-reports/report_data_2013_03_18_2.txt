H5N1 in Poultry in India
 The Union health ministry confirmed earlier this week that two districts, Purnia and Madhepura, both in the Indian state of Bihar, have detected outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus.  This is the first time in 2013 that H5N1 has been detected in India.  338 chickens died at a government poultry farm in Purnea within a few days. In Madhepura, 800 chickens have died after coming in contact with the deadly virus.  Throughout the state, precautionary steps including culling, border monitoring, and banning the sale of chicken and eggs, are all in place to help prevent further outbreaks.  The Patna Zoo in Purnea has announced that it has increased the frequency of sanitation work to reduce the risk of possible introduction of the virus to the zooâ€™s collection of birds and animals.
