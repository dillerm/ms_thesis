H5N1 in Poultry in Australia
 The Australian Department of Agriculture and Food confirmed earlier this week that a duck, which was part of a backyard flock of 71 ducks and chickens, was infected with low-pathogenic avian influenza in Perth, the capital of Western Australia, The duck has been sick, but while testing was being conducted, the flock was moved to a second location containing additional birds. The authorities believe that this outbreak poses no threat to humans, about 100 ducks and chickens at both affected areas were culled to help prevent further outbreaks.  Additionally, authorities are monitoring the area and urging owners of backyard poultry to keep their birds away from wild birds, keep their backyards clean, and to alert their local vet if they encounter any sick or dead birds.
