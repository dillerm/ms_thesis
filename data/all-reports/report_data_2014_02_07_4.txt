China (LPAI H10N8)
 Scientists around the world are growing more concerned with H10N8, a new strain of the avian influenza virus capable of infecting humans.  The first victim, a 73-year-old woman from Nanchang City in Jiangxi province, died on December 6, and the second victim, a 55-year-old woman also from Jiangxi province, is currently in critical condition.  Scientists are especially interested in the second case as â€œIt reveals that the H10N8 virus has continued to circulate and may cause more human infections in future."  More research is being done on this deadly virus and tests on both humans and poultry have increased in hopes to offer new insight.
