H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
Over 460 unvaccinated ducks have died in the Tran Van Thoi district in the southern province of Ca Mau. Tests have confirmed H5N1, according to the head of Tran Van Thoi District’s Veterinary Station.  The outbreak continues to spread according to an official from the provincial Bird Flu Prevention Committee. H5N1 was first detected in a flock in Nguyen Van Dong in Khanh Binh Commune last month and has since spread to five of the nine hamlets in Khanh Binh and to three households in Khanh Bing Dong.
