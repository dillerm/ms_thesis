The Poultry Epidemics and Diseases at the Agriculture Ministry confirmed cases of avian influenza in 16 locations in the Sohag, Qena, Aswan, and North Sinai Governorates. The director of the Ministry, Moussa Suleiman, reports that all birds at these locations, 14 in farms and 2 at markets, have been vaccinated. As a precaution against the disease, a ban on importing birds is currently in place until March. On January 16 in the Sharqia Governorate a 30-month-old child reportedly died of avian influenza. The Ministry further notes that although 1,024 cases of suspected avian influenza in people have been reported in Egypt since November, most of these tested negative.
