H5N1 in poultry. in India
Tripura Animal Resource Development Department Joint Director Jyotirmoy Chakraborty reported that, since March 1, at least 400 birds have died at the Gandhigram, a Tripura government poultry farm.  Chakraborty confirmed on March 6 that central government experts tested samples of the dead birds from the farm and found them positive for the H5N1 bird flu; he added that, for further confirmation, samples had been sent to Eastern Region Disease Diagnostic Laboratory (ERDDL) in Kolkata and the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL) in Bhopal.  At the time of Chakrabortyâ€™s statement, government officials said that, if the two reports also confirmed the bird flu infection, culling of birds from the farm would begin the following Monday.  The Gandhigram farm case follows one that occurred last month in western Tripura, in which more than 6,000 ducks and poultry birds were culled.  Since that event, Tripura has sounded a bird flu alert and intensified surveillance across the bordering state.  The government has taken measures to check its spread in other areas, including a ban on the import of poultry birds, ducks and other poultry products from outside the state.
