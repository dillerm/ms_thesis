The suspected outbreak, which occurred near a military base in  South Hamgyong province near the capital Pyongyang, would be the first reported case in the country since 2005. South Korean reports of avian flu in the region cite North Korean quarantine authorities, but the claim has not yet been confirmed by either South or North Korean officials.
