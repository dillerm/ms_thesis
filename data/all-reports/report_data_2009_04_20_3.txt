H5N1 in Poultry in Egypt
A workshop held on April 11 by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the General Authority for Veterinary Services determined that only 36 percent of the 300 million birds on rural farms are protected from bird flu by vaccines. "The amount of vaccinations is barely sufficient to cover the workforce that will distribute them and the responsive farmers who are willing to vaccinate their birds," Saber Abdel Aziz, head of the epidemic and poultry diseases at the General Authority for Veterinary Services, told Daily News Egypt. Participants say that 600 million vaccines would be needed to adequately cover poultry but the authority can only afford to produce 120 million. They also criticized the lack of funding for qualified veterinarians, only 1,200 when 5,000 are needed, and necessary equipment. There have also been problems in Egypt with unresponsive farmers who are not sufficiently informed about the risks of bird flu.
