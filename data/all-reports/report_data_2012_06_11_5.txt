Russia (LPAI H9)
The Russian Federal Service for Veterinary and Phytosanitary Surveillance (Rosselkhoznadzor), announced that low pathogenic H9 bird flu was recently discovered among pathological material selected from a major Russian poultry company, Amur Chicken, in Blagoveshensk in Amur Oblast. After preliminary testing, experts suspect that the virus came from China, which lies across the river from Blagoveshensk. Rosselkhoznadzor warned that low pathogenic virus circulating among poultry could become more pathogenic, possibly leading to an outbreak of highly pathogenic bird flu. In April, 7,000 poultry died at this facility. These deaths were attributed to mycotoxins in the feed, but Veterinary Service specialists refuted this claim. Whether the two events are linked is not known at the present time.
