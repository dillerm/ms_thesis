H5N1 in Poultry in Thailand
The northern part of Thailand has been alerted of a possible bird flu outbreak after the death of nearly 100 birds in Nan. The poultry died in six districts of the province between October 7 and November 5. The livestock department in Nan collected samples from the dead birds and sent them to the regional office of the National Institute of Animal Health for testing. Another outbreak, suspected of being caused by H5N1, killed 1,000 ducks in Suphan Buri province. On November 16, Thailand's Minister of Public Health Witthaya Kaewparadai told provincial health chiefs to prepare 1,500 local rapid response units to work with animal husbandry officials in investigating new outbreaks and controlling the spread of the disease. He added that the rest of the ducks from the infected flock were culled as a precautionary measure and that government workers are awaiting laboratory test results from Kasetsart University to confirm the cause of death. Director-General Dr Manit Theeratantikanont of the Disease Control Department urged local residents to inform officials or health volunteers if they find any poultry or wild birds dead of unknown causes.
