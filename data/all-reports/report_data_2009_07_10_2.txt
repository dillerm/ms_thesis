H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A female patient who was hospitalized with suspected H5N1 on June 29 died on July 4. The patient was from Sungaibuluh in Dharmasraya District. She was in critical condition on July 4 when she was transferred to M Djamil hospital, but she died only five hours later. Her symptoms included high fever and shortness of breath but H5N1 has not been confirmed. A nurse who treated the patient is also showing symptoms consistent with bird flu and is now being treated. It is suspected that additional residents from Bojong Kembar village in Jawa Barat (West Java) province have contracted bird flu. As many as eight people, whose ages vary from 15 to 90, began to show symptoms of severe flu and fever after several chickens died suddenly in the area. They had all attended a wedding reception in the neighborhood at which they consumed meat from chickens that had died suddenly. Authorities have not confirmed bird flu as the cause of these poultry die-offs; nevertheless, they are monitoring these residents closely.
