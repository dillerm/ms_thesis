Japan (HPAI H5N8)
The highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus was confirmed at a poultry farm in Okayama Prefecture.  Roughly 200,000 chickens will be culled to prevent the disease from spreading.  Authorities have also banned movement of chickens and eggs at six farms within 3 kilometers, and 15 other farms within 10 kilometers have been ordered not to ship products.  Okayama is Japan's fourth largest egg producing prefecture and has 10 million breeding hens. This marks the fourth case of avian influenza at a poultry farm in Japan this winter.
