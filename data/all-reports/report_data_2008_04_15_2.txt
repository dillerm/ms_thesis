H5N1 in Poultry in India.
Bird flu has been reported from the remote eastern state of Tripura, which borders Bangladesh; 3,000 chickens, ducks, crows and other birds  have died since April 3, with signs that suggest bird flu. H5N1 has been detected from samples sent to the High Security Research Laboratory in Bhopal. In the official report, only 98 backyard poultry in one village died. Ashis Roy Burman, director of Tripura's Animal Resources Development Department said that "The virus must have spread from Bangladesh."  The UN’s Influenza coordinator David Nabarro noted that H5N1 has re-infected poultry in four districts in India: Jalpaiguri, Malda, Murshidabad, and Nadia, as well as in 47 districts in neighboring Bangladesh. Nabarro said that this may indicate that the virus has become entrenched in the Indo-Gangetic plains of India. An entrenched virus would take longer to stamp out and would pose a higher risk of continuous reinfection. He said, "Entrenched viruses would be a threat to the entire country and would cause sporadic outbreaks at regular intervals. It would multiply freely among poultry, keeping alive the risk of a human pandemic.”
