7 additional cases of the highly pathogeni H5N2 avian influenza virus have been confirmed by the United States Deapartment of Agriculture Animal and Health Inspection Service (APHIS).  Outbreaks occurred in Iowa at turkey farms in Hamilton County (19,600 birds) and Sac County (42,200 birds).  In Minnesota, outbreaks were reported at turkeys farms in Brown County (39,000 birds), Kandiyohi County (4,000 birds), and Renville County (4,800 birds) and a chicken farm in Renville County (15,000 birds).  Nebraska reported an outbreak in a backyard flock in Dixon County.  To prevent further spread of the disease, all affected premises have been quarantined, and the surviving birds culled. Premises in four counties in Arizona were placed under quarantine Friday (6/12/15) because they had received chicken, quail or pheasant birds or eggs from a farm in Iowa in the week before H5N2 was detected. The Iowa farm is suspected to have shipped similar samples to other parts of the country. Follow up investigation, including laboratory testing, is being conducted.
