H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
Authorities in Gazipur District are culling over 150,000 poultry birds and destroying 500,000 eggs after confirming an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu on December 24.  The birds on a farm owned by Bay-Agro Industries Ltd. had started dying around December 20, and around 150 workers have been culling infected poultry. Tests done at the Gazipur District Livestock Hospital in Dhaka showed that the birds had died from H5N1 bird flu, prompting the government to get involved in the culling of all birds on the farm. The Upazila Livestock Department is investigating the source of the outbreak and are monitoring for infections in poultry within a one kilometer radius of the farm. The owner will be compensated for the loss of eggs and birds. This is the 23rd outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in Bangladesh this year.
