H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
In Tambelang, Bekasi, West Java, H5N1 bird flu has killed 600 commercial and 52 backyard chickens. Laboratory tests by the Livestock Service Bekasi confirmed bird flu. The dead chickens have been burned and buried and their cages have been disinfected to prevent the spread of the disease. Within the month of January, around 200 backyard chickens in the Subdistrict of Sambutan and in Sungaipinang, Samarinda, East Kalimantan died from H5N1 bird flu. It is thought that the disease is coming from outside Samarinda, possibly from Mugirejo, through backyard chickens brought in by locals.
