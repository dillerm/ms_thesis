H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
Local media in Hong Kong claim that infected sparrows initiated a bird flu outbreak in early January.  The sparrows were thought to have access to poultry enclosures and feed on a farm where the outbreak occurred.  Though the coops were designed to separate the chickens from wild birds, the sparrows were small enough to pass through, infecting the birds inside. The Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department has not directly implicated sparrows, but Ho Pak-Leung, a microbiologist at the University of Hong Kong noted that biosecurity clearly failed at the farm and other sparrows in both China and Hong Kong have been infected with H5N1.
