H5N1 in Poultry in West Bank
At least 750,000 chickens infected with bird flu will be culled in the Tulkarem area. Palestinian police surrounded the area to ensure that the infected birds will not be transported out. Municipal council leader Bal’a Ahmad Mansur said, "Tension and anxiety are prevailing among the farmers, at least 40% of the town's economy is in chickens.” The avian flu outbreak came to light when a farmer noticed symptoms in some of his chicks and called officials in to test the birds. No human cases have been reported yet, but doctors are monitoring the local clinics and distributing information on symptoms to farming families. As preventative measures the farms will be disinfected, the birds will be buried, and a quarantine parameter of up to a 3km radius of the area will be put in place.
