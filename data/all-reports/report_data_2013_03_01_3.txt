H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
 The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed two new cases of HPAI H5N1 in Cambodia, bringing the number of human deaths to eight and the total number of cases to nine since the start of the year.  The most recent victims, a thirty-five-year-old man and a two-year-old boy, from the provinces of Kampot and Kampong Cham respectively, both died after contracting the deadly virus.  None of the cases appear to be linked epidemiologically.These latest deaths have triggered Cambodia’s Prime Miniester Hun Sen to issue a “directive for police, agriculture, and health departments to join forces to combat the virus.”  To hopefully prevent further outbreaks of this deadly virus, poultry farms and markets throughout the country will be disinfected and cross-border transportation will be stopped.  Additionally, health officials are warning people to wash their hands regularly, keep children away from poultry, and to report dead poultry immediately.
