H5N1 in Wild birds in Canada
 The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has issued an advance contract notice for companies interested in participating in a study to detect levels and patterns of bird flu in Canada.  About 600 dabbling ducks and 2,000 various aquatic birds will be tested from different Canadian provinces at a lab in Winnipeg with results stored in a national database.  Soren Alexandersen, executive director of the CFIAâ€™s National Center for Foreign Animal Disease, stated that it is important to track avian influenza strains and use this background information in the event of a possible poultry infection or a public health risk.  The survey, funded by both Canadian and U.S. governments, offers an initial $250,000 contract with another $500,000 for two more years if the study is extended.
