Israel (HPAI H5N1)
According to the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE), the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus caused the death of 15,000 birds at a turkey farm in Moshav Avi'el, in the northern district of Hazafon, near Haifa.  More than 140,000 birds will be culled to prevent the disease from spreading, including 61,000 turkeys at a nearby farm showing no clinical signs. In addition to culling, the Agriculture Ministry will continue monitoring poultry with 10 kilometers of the Hazafon farm.  Other control measures include an increase in border-crossing enforcement and a ban on the entrance of poultry.  (See entry under Palestinian Territories below for related outbreaks.)
