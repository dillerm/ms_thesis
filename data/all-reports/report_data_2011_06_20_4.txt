South Africa (not H5N1)
Outbreaks of Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N2 were detected in four additional commercial ostrich farms in Western Cape Province between June 19 and 21. A total of 2,576 ostriches were housed on the farms and 26 tested positive for H5 bird flu by PCR. No clinical signs or mortalities were seen and the source of the outbreak is unknown. The farms have enacted control measures including quarantine and screening and plan to cull the birds in order to stamp out the disease.
