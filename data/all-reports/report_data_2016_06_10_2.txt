Hong Kong (LPAI H7N9)
On June 5, 2016, as a result of routine surveillance testing at the University of Hong Kong, fecal droppings of live poultry have tested positive for the H7N9 avian influenza virus. The samples were taken from a poultry stall in Yan Oi Market in Tuen Mun on May 16. The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) declared the status of the live poultry stalls at Yan Oi Market in Tuen Mun as infected.  Yan Oi and a second live bird market were closed for thorough disinfection and cleansing.  Live poultry stall operators normally slaughter all live poultry in the stalls before 8pm every evening and no live poultry can be kept on the premises between 8pm and 5am the following day so premises can be disinfected. In the present case, the markets were closed for three days but were re-opened on Jun 9, right before the popular Dragon Boat Festival. Each month, a total of 300 fecal and drinking samples are taken from 30 venues, including 25 live poultry stalls at Food and Environmental Hygiene Department approved markets and five licensed fresh provision shops with endorsement to sell live poultry for testing by University of Hong Kong. The AFCD has conducted inspection on all local chicken farms and all samples collected for AI testing have been negative.  Import of live poultry will also be suspended.  Surveillance and monitoring of local chicken farms will continue. All poultry farmers are instructed to immediately report any abnormalities and adhere strictly to the biosecurity measures at the farms.
