China (H7N9)
A joint study, recently published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, between HKU and Zhejiang University’s First Affiliated Hospital in Hangzhou suggests that H7N9 may be spreading through human feces. Researchers tested 12 patients admitted to the intensive care unit between April 10 and 23. Of the stool samples collected during post-mortem tests of the six patients who died, four samples tested positive for the H7N9 strain. H7N9 was not found in the dead patients’ blood or urine samples, or in tissue samples from the lung, heart, liver, kidney, or bone marrow. The research team suggested that the possibility of the virus spreading through feces may account for there being few recorded cases of human-to-human infection. Since the first know human case of H7N9 was reported in March, 135 cases and 45 deaths have been confirmed. Separately, Tommy Lam and colleagues, in a study published in the journal Nature this week, showed that the H7N9 virus likely originated from wild bird H7 viruses which reassorted with endemic H9N2 viruses. The mixing might have occurred in domestic ducks but the H7N9 viruses were found only in chickens in the present study. The group also discovered a hitherto unknown group of H7N7 viruses in Chinese poultry that were able to infect ferrets, suggesting that the H7N7 viruses may be of future pandemic concern.
