H5N1 in Wild Birds in United Kingdom
 The Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs is advising  increased patrols to monitor for H5N1 in Britain. The increased  monitoring would be for dead birds as well as live caught and hunter-killed  birds on wild bird reserves in the southeast where migrating birds  from the affected parts of Europe are likely to come. The patrols will  include the sampling of live caught wild birds and birds shot  during normal hunting activities and the screening of wild birds found  dead. Gulls, ducks, geese and swans from this area will be sent for  laboratory testing.
