Philippines (suspect avian influenza)
The Department of Public Health (DOH) reported a possible case of avian influenza virus in a 52-year-old male overseas worker from China.  A day after arriving in the Philippines, the patient experienced cough, fever, and stomach pains, and passed away a few days later.  An autopsy was not conducted due to fears of exposure to the virus, and the case was declared closed by the DOH without a final diagnosis.  The man had worked in China for six years as a musician and is suspected to have been in contact with live poultry.
