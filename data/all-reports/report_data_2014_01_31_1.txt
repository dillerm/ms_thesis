South Korea (LPAI H5N8)
The Republic of Korea’s Animal and Plant Quarantine Agency has confirmed the presence of H5N8 at two farms in Naju, South Jeolla Province and Cheonan, South Chungcheong. A poultry farm in Milyang, South Gyeongsang Province as well as a chicken farm in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province have reported the suspected presence of bird flu this week. A total of 18 farms in six provinces are considered positive according to the South Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (MAFF).  Recent reports are leading authorities to believe that the highly pathogenic virus may be spreading to the southeast, as migratory birds collected from Eulsukdo in Busan this week have also tested positive for avian influenza. Officials are currently testing to see if these birds have the same H5N8 strain. The government said that migratory birds is the likely source of the outbreaks, but the Scientific Task Force on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds, convened by the United Nationals Environmental Programme has released a statement that “There is currently no evidence that wild birds are the source of this virus and they should be considered victims not vectors ” and that “focusing attention on wild birds can misdirect critical resources away from effective disease control and result in negative conservation outcomes and loss of biodiversity.” Efforts to stop the spread are being taken; 18,000 birds located at the farm in Gyeonggi were destroyed, and all farms within 3 kilometers of the two farms in Jeolla and South Chungcheong have been culled. More than 400,000 total ducks and chickens have been either culled or destroyed since the beginning of the outbreak.
