H5N1 in Wild birds in India
Because of the H5N1 outbreaks in poultry, wild bird monitoring has been stepped up in the forests around Malda and in water bodies near the Farakka Barrage on the border between India and Bangladesh. No sick or dead wild birds have been detected. The Farakka Barrage area contains a large amounts of waterfowl that forage in the rice paddy fields. Around half a dozen birds of an unspecified species have died at the Gharana wetlands on the border between the two countries. While H5N1 has not been reported in the area, samples will be tested as a precaution.
