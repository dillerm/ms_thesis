Avian Influenza in Wild Birds in Japan (HPAI H5N8)
The Environment Ministry confirmed the discovery of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N8) today from two wild bird environmental samples collected on November 3rd in Yasugi, Shimane Prefecture in western Japan. The H5N8 strain was detected on November 3rd in two samples of droppings from migratory tundra swans (Cygnus columbianus). This is the same strain of avian influenza that was detected in South Korea in January and Kumamoto Prefecture Japan in April of this year. In 2010, the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain of avian influenza was first detected in wild bird fecal samples before outbreaks in farms and wild birds throughout Japan. HPAI H5N8 was reported last week in a farm in Germany and analysis of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase RNA segments show that the German virus is closely related to the virus in South Korea. Whether the Japan H5N8 is related to the same group is not known at this time. The source of the introduction of the HPAI H5N8 virus into Germany is unknown at this time, but the finding of HPAI H5N8 in wild bird fecal samples in Japan might support one mechanism of introduction. The Prefecture is warning all local poultry farms to take preventative measures against infection.
