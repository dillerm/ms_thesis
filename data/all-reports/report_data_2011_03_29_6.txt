H5N1 in Poultry in Myanmar
 OIE recently reported 350 new cases of H5N1 bird flu in poultry in Myanmar. 780 layer chickens, aged 4 months and 19 months old, were housed in two sheds on a farm in Sagaing. Birds began to die on March 16, and 350 chickens died within four days.  The source of the outbreak is unknown. The Livestock Breeding and Veterinary Department applied a number of measures to effectively contain the event, including culling the poultry within 1-km radius of the infected flock, cleaning and disinfecting the infected premises, restricting movement of poultry in and out of the infected area, and banning the sale of poultry and poultry products in the infected and restricted areas.
