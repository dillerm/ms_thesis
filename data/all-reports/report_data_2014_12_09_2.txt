Avian Influenza in Wild Animals in The Netherlands (HPAI H5)
According to researchers from the Erasmus Medical Centre in Rotterdam, fecal samples from two wigeons tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5 strain of avian influenza. It is not yet known what the N type is, but sequence analysis so far by the researchers shows the wigeon virus is "genetically almost identical" to those in the five other outbreaks in the Netherlands over the past two weeks at poultry farms. Poultry sector organization Nepluvi said that the government needs to change its approach now that it seems wild duck are spreading the disease. In particular, they advocate that the rules on moving poultry and eggs should be relaxed in areas without large expanses of water where ducks could congregate. But experts say the finding of the virus in wild birds does not necessarily mean that wild birds were the way that the H5N8 virus was introduced as wild birds could have been infected from contaminated materials carried into the fields from the farms.
