H5N1 in Poultry in Germany (LPAI).
On a farm in Nordrhein-Westfalen 4,000 birds have tested positive for low pathogenic avian influenza. Tests were performed at the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute. All 20,000 birds housed on the farm have been culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Other control measures have been put in place such as control of wildlife reservoirs, quarantine, movement control, screening, zoning, and disinfection of the infected premises.
