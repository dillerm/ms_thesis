H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
There have been four outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in Hong Kong in wild birds between January 30 and February 8. The birds affected include 2 little egrets (Egretta garzetta), 1 oriental magpie robin (Copsychus saularis), and 1 grey heron (Ardea cinerea). These four dead birds and a goose carcass from an unknown source were detected during an ongoing surveillance program for wild birds. An intensive surveillance system is in place for all poultry farms, poultry markets and pet bird shops in Hong Kong. The cause of the outbreaks is unknown, but a total of 19,451 poultry, including 15,569 chickens, 810 pigeons, 1,950 pheasants and 1,122 silky fowls were culled in the Cheung Sha Wan Temporary Wholesale Poultry Market on December 21 as a precautionary measure.
