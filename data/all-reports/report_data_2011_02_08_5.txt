H5N1 in Humans in Iraq
A source in the Department of Health in Baghdad reported on January 20 that two young girls had died from H5N1 bird flu. A medical source said that the girls died from the virus and because their parents did not bring them in for treatment until the virus was advanced. The Director of General Health in Baghdad, Ihsan Jaafar, reported the capital has had 19 cases of bird flu since the beginning of January and that some cases are controlled but other patients are in critical condition. The Federal Ministry of Health fears that the disease will spread in remote areas far from health facilities. With regard to the possibility of reducing the incidence of bird flu Jafaar added that “the only solution is awareness.” There has been no independent confirmation of this report.
