H5N1 in Humans in Egypt
The Ministry of Health announced on April 5 that an 18-year-old woman from Fayoum has died of bird flu; she is the 34th human death from bird flu since the disease first broke out in Egypt.  Just one week earlier, Minister of Health Hatem El-Gabaly had praised the success of the governmentâ€™s plan for combating H5N1 bird flu, since the death rate from the virus has substantially decreased while citizen awareness has increased. Currently, committees are inspecting bird farms around the country to discover bird flu centers. The labs associated with the program have tested 11,565 cases suspected of bird flu.
