Palestinian Territories (HPAI H5N1)
Two additional cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus have been reported at two duck farms in the northern and southern Gaza Strip.  All of the surviving birds were culled to prevent the disease from spreading.  In addition to culling, the affected premises have been quarantined, and movement control and surveillance measures have been put in place.
