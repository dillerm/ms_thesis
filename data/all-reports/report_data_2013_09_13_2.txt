Avian Influenza in Poultry in Italy (H7N7)
Italian officials are reporting another three outbreaks of H7N7, after farms in the provinces of Bologna and Ferrara recently confirmed the presence of the strain. This brings the total number of outbreaks to 6 since August 28, according to researchers in Legnaro, Italy. Two of the farms affected were commercial and are owned by the same company as in some of the earlier outbreaks, while the third outbreak occurred in a small backyard flock. About 220,000 birds were destroyed in the three locations to prevent the spread of the outbreak, compared to the 730,000 total destroyed during the previous three outbreaks. Control measures being applied include stamping out, screening, disinfection of affected areas, quarantine, movement control, and limitations on treatment and vaccination.
