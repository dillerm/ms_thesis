LPAI in Poultry in Japan
H7N6 avian influenza was detected on a quail farm in Toyohashi, Aichi prefecture. Seven quail tested positive during a routine inspection of the 320,000-bird farm. None of the birds have died from the disease, which suggests a low-pathogenic strain. 260,000 birds will be culled and composted to prevent the disease from spreading. On March 4, H7 was discovered at a second quail farm located less than 5 km from the farm where the outbreak began. An additional 5 km movement restriction area has been established around the second farm.
