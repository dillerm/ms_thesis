H5N1 in Wild Birds in Hong Kong
A government panel of scientists concluded that the first bird flu outbreak in a commercial poultry farm in six years in Hong Kong in Dec. 2007 was "most likely to have been introduced to the farm by wild birds." The virus present in droppings, could have been blown by a gust of wind into the farm, or tracked in on contaminated clothing of farm workers or even by other animals such as rodents, the scientists say.
