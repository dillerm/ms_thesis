A new outbreak of unspecified avian influenza was reported at a chicken farm in South Chungcheong Province, central South Korea: 100 chickens died, and 90,000 were slaughtered at the farm after samples from that farm tested positive for avian influenza.  Another 1,108 chickens and ducks were slaughtered at farms within 1.9 miles of the affected chicken farm.  Officials believe that feces from migrating birds were the source of this outbreak; the virus may have been transported in feces-contaminated water.
