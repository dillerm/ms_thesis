H5N1 Avian Influenza in Humans in Nepal
 Health officials at the Teaching Hospital of College of Medical Sciences in Bharatpur suspect that the H5N1 virus is the cause of the recent deaths of two women.  Both women presented with common cold-like symptoms, and after “the twin deaths”, authorities believe that the women were infected with the virus; however, no samples were collected from either of the victims.  At the same hospital, another female patient is suffering from similar symptoms.  The woman, who lives near the Nawalparasi district, where a number of cases of bird flu cases have been confirmed, has been given Tamiflu and throat and nasal swabs were collected.  Health officials hope to have the results back in one week. Due to the high number of outbreaks of bird flu throughout Nepal this year, the government has culled close to one million birds in the Bhaktapur district since the first outbreak was reported on the 26th of July.  Officials plan to destroy all homegrown chickens and ducks within the next couple of weeks in hopes to prevent the disease from spreading any further.Additionally, the travel advisory committee from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a travel advisory to all Saudi nationals against traveling to Katmandu due to the recent outbreaks of the bird flu virus and the declaration of avian flu emergency.  So far this year, about 50 cases of the H5N1 virus have been reported in Katmandu.
