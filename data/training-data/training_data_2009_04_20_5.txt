H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
Bird flu continues to spread in Riau following the death of a child in late March. There were reports of poultry in the area dying abruptly on April 4. \"After checking by a team of veterinarians, two of the chickens tested positive for bird flu. A day earlier, we received reports that 12 chickens owned by other residents had died suddenly,\" Indra Atmaja told The Jakarta Post. The bird flu has spread to the neighboring villages of Teluk Masjid and Teluk Batil. Village chiefs are raising awareness of the disease and a team from the Siak Animal Husbandry agency sprayed the poultry cages with disinfectant to prevent the disease from spreading. Residents are encouraged to cull their poultry but many are unwilling since the district office does not have a budget to compensate them for dead birds.
