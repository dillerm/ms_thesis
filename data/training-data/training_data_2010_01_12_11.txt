Russia.
On a farm in the Chuvashskaya province, the Federal Centre for Animal Health confirmed 45 cases of pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus. The outbreak was confirmed on December 3, but probably began on November 10. The farm holds 10,625 pigs, but the cases were isolated to one building holding 1,800 pigs. The pigs are thought to have contracted the disease through contact with infected personnel. A ban has been placed on the trade of live pigs or swine products from the farm unless they have undergone thermal treatment. The farm has also implemented regular aerosol disinfection.
