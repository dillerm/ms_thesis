China (HPAI H7N9)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports a new outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza in a livestock market in Guangdong, China.  Samples were collected at a live bird market on January 10 2017, and an unspecified number of samples have tested positive for the virus.  This is the first time that the highly pathogenic form of the H7N9 virus has been detected in poultry.  Since the appearance of H7N9 in Chinese poultry in 2013, all previous detections have been of the low pathogenicity form. The markets in question have been closed and regional surveillance has increased; additional control measures include movement control inside the country, screening, disinfection/disinfestation, and quarantine.  Vaccination is permitted, and there has been no treatment of affected animals
