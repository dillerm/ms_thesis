Some birds in the 50,000 bird flock showed signs of respiratory distress on Jan 20th, and the British Columbia provincial laboratory tested and detected a low pathogenic strain of avian influenza. The sequence was 99% related to another H5 virus (H5N2) from California that was found in 2007. The source of the virus is not known, but contact with wild birds is suspected. The 26 farms that fall within a 3 km radius around the infected farm have been placed under quarantine, and a dead bird surveillance program has been instituted. So far all the farms have tested negative.",

The lack of a reference laboratory in Nepal means that even negative samples are sent to London for further testing.

He had contact with sick and dead poultry before becoming ill, and was transferred to a hospital in Yulin where he later died.  China totals five fatalities and seven known cases of H5N1 in humans this year.The Health Ministry, Agriculture Ministry and State Administration for Industry and Commerce has activated a system where provincial departments have to report every day on whether there is infection in their respective areas. However, the UN has said that the lack of poultry outbreaks in association with the human cases raises questions about the effectiveness of China's monitoring system. \"If you have human cases here and there and you cannot relate them to a poultry outbreak,\" said Vincent Martin of UN's FAO. \"You start wondering, 'Is it really working?'\"",
