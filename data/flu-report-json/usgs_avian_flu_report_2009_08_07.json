	"content_2": "On August 5 the Minnesota Board of Animal Health quarantined a commercial turkey flock in Meeker County after avian influenza H7N9 virus was discovered during routine testing. Dale Lauer, the assistant director and a veterinarian, stressed that the flu strain was different from the more lethal H5N1 strain circulating mostly in Asia. The quarantined flock is not showing signs of illness, but officials are concerned that without precautions the virus could evolve into a strain that would be lethal to the state’s many poultry flocks. The infected flock and those within a 3-mile radius have been placed under quarantine for six weeks and will be tested repeatedly for the virus. The Minnesota Health Department is monitoring 20 poultry workers from the farm, but so far none of them have shown any symptoms.",

She is exhibiting symptoms such as fever, cough, nausea, and suffocation. She became ill after a number of chickens around her home died suddenly. The girl is now receiving treatment in an isolation room. A government team has been assigned to conduct surveillance in the girl’s neighborhood as part of an effort to prevent the virus from spreading. Over 100 people in Indonesia have died from H5N1 since the disease first emerged."
