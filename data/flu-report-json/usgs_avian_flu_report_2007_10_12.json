	"content_2": "At least five ducks have died in a flock of 300 in the delta province of Tra Vinh and tests have identified H5N1. Bird flu had not been reported in Vietnam for almost two months, but the latest outbreak is in the same district that was affected in August. Although the birds on the affected farm had been culled and a transportation ban imposed on the village, some reports suggest that the birds may have died about a month before the virus was reported, raising concerns about possible spread before the culling began."
