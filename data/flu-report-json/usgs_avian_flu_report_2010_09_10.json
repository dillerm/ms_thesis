A study has shown that gulls brought the bird flu virus back to Thailand. \"We have scientific evidence that a seagull was the carrier of the birdflu virus, not the openbill stork,\" said Professor Pilaipan Puthavathana of Mahidol University's Department of Microbiology. His research team studied the migratory patterns of birds and discovered that some brown headed gulls fly to Cambodia and China in the winter. The team isolated the H5N1 virus in four of 153 birds of this flock in 2005 and 2008. The flock might have played a role in the spread of H5N1 virus along its route. The researchers hope that this information will help in surveillance efforts.",

Samples were collected and sent to the Animal Health Research Institute for diagnosis. Testing revealed the pigs were infected with the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Only 4 cases were confirmed in a herd of 4,000 pigs. Prevention methods such as movement control and disinfection of the premises were implemented. Follow-up tests on September 6 returned negative results."
