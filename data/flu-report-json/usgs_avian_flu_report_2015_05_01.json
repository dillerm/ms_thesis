This marks the furthest east within the Mississippi flyway where the virus has been identified.",

	"content_2": "A Cooper’s hawk found dead in Yellow Medicine County is the first wild bird in the state to test positive for the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus.  The bird is believed to have contracted the virus through eating infected bird, but although wild waterfowls such as dabbling ducks and goose are known capable of being infected with the virus, they are usually too large for a Coopers hawk, whose normal prey are small passerines.  Scientists say the discovery of the hawk does not indicate that wild birds are the direct cause of avian influenza in poultry, and Yellow Medicine County has not reported any cases of infected farms. The testing of 2,200 other wild bird samples collected this far this spring have been negative for the high path virus.",

A total of 13,137 birds died and the rest were culled to prevent the disease from spreading.  Two cases of the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus were also reported in a goose farm in Yunlin County with 5,740 birds and another in Changhua County with 1,4000 geese.  A total of 3,695 birds died and the rest were destroyed.  In addition to culling, all five facilities have been placed under movement restriction and farms within a 3 km radius are under intensified surveillance.",

	"content_4": "A case of the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus has been reported at a turkey farm in Oxford County with 8,000 birds. This marks the third case in southwestern Ontario.  The farm was within a quarantine zone imposed after the virus was discovered at a nearby chicken facility, and scientists are unsure if the virus got past biocontrols or was present before the quarantine was put in place.  To date, over 80,000 birds have died or been destroyed due to the virus.",
