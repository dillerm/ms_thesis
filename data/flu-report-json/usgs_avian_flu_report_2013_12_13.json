Guangdong health authorities collected 70 samples from 13 live poultry markets in Shenzhen, and three samples from two different markets have tested positive for the bird flu H7N9. The authorities have been warning the general public to be aware of H7N9 transmission risks, but the markets remain open at the present time. Efforts have been made to tighten prevention measures after three new cases were recently confirmed in Hong Kong and east China’s Zhejiang Province. The Chinese mainland has now had a total of 140 human H7N9 cases reported, and out of that total, 53 have died.",

	"content_2": "The Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong has reported three new human cases of H7N9 in recent weeks. The first individual, a 36-year-old domestic helper, may have contracted the virus from one of the markets in Shenzhen that was recently found to be infected with H7N9. The second patient, an 80-year-old male, had also recently visited Shenzhen, but had not directly handled any live birds. In the third case, a 30-year-old man from Zhejiang, who is the son-in-law of an earlier confirmed case was found infected with H7N9. Whether he became infected by person-to-person transmission or by exposure to infected poultry is not known. The commission is warning that the risk of the bird flu spreading in the province is high and has urged the public to stay alert."
