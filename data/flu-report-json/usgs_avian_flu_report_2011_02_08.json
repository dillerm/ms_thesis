	"content_1": ". This winter H5N1 bird flu has been spreading through Japan at an unprecedented rate. The route of infection has not been established in all cases, but it is highly likely that migratory birds from the north were carriers of the infectious disease. The outbreaks in Kagoshima and Shimani prefectures both took place near wintering grounds of migratory birds. The disease has a ten day incubation period in wild birds allowing them to travel great distances before they become ill. It is thought that small birds became infected from the droppings of migratory birds and carried the disease to the farms. The origin of the outbreaks in Aichi prefecture has not yet been determined.In Tottori prefecture, further testing confirmed H5N1 in a tufted duck and a hooded gull found ill last month. No signs of infection have been found in nearby poultry farms. Detailed tests in Hokkaido confirmed H5N1 in a whooper swan that had been found dead in mid-January.",

The carcasses of the birds were buried on February 3 under the supervision of the district livestock department. The bird flu infection was confirmed when the livestock department sent a sample of the tissue to the Central Diseases Investigation Laboratory in Dhaka on February 2 after some of the chickens of the farm had died.

An outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in Jambi province that caused the deaths of at least 4,164 chickens in Kerinci regency was reported on February 2. \"To prevent spreading disease, Animal Husbandry Division of Kerinci regency is now working hard to supervise people and to spray disinfectant,\" said Secretary of Animal Husbandry Division of Kerinci regency, Igor. Head of Animal Health Division of Kerinci regency, Ariyan, admitted that there are still many villagers who do not want to destroy their chickens. \"However, we keep supervising them,\" she said.Outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in Prabumulih and Palembang in South Sumatra have led municipal governments to call for the mass culling of sick animals. The outbreak came as a shock after many thought the disease had been successfully curbed over the last several years. Prabumulih municipal Horticulture, Agriculture, Husbandry and Fishery (PPKPP) Agency chief R.A. Hanunah said, “At this moment we’re continuing to conduct dissemination activities, especially in the affected areas.” She urged local residents to keep their poultry in sheds and rather than allowing them to roam freely through neighborhoods. This will make it easier to watch the animals for signs of disease and to avoid transmission of the virus to humans. The agency undertook additional control measures such as disinfecting poultry sheds in endemic areas and culling eggs laid by sick birds. Palembang municipal Agriculture, Fishery and Forestry Agency head Sudirman Teguh said at least 25 birds have died from avian flu in the municipality. We have conducted follow-up measures by expanding the mass cleaning activities to a radius of 1 kilometer,” he said, January 31. He has also created a task force to prevent the flow of birds into the area from other cities.",

Of the 7 birds tested, 6 were positive for H5N1 bird flu in a preliminary exam.  Chickens in two more locations in Miyazaki prefecture have tested positive for H5N1 bird flu according to a report on January 29. A Nobeoka poultry farm found six of its chickens had died recently, while a Kawaminami farm had more than 400 chickens die after exhibiting bird flu symptoms. The local government has decided to cull about 92,000 birds at the Kawaminami farm and conduct a detailed investigation. Meanwhile, all 31,000 chickens from poultry farm in Tsuno and its affiliated meat-processing center were culled after 186 chickens shipped from the farm were found dead January 27. H5N1 has been confirmed from the Tsuno birds. A fourth location in Miyazaki prefecture was reported positive for H5N1 bird flu on January 31. Of 90 birds found dead at a farm in Takanabe  five were tested and four were positive for bird flu confirming the season’s sixth outbreak of bird flu in the prefecture and the ninth in the country. On January 31, officials started culling all 40,000 chickens on the farm and announced plans to impose a ban on transporting chickens or eggs from farms within a 10 km radius. For the time being the Japanese government has asked Miyazaki prefecture to report the number of birds on poultry farms that die each day. The prefectural government was found Friday to have allowed a company affiliated with the farm in the city of Miyazaki, the first to have an outbreak, to carry out on-the-spot inspections on its behalf last year. Inspections by the central government after the outbreak showed a number of holes in the farm’s bird net, which is intended to prevent wild birds from entering the poultry houses. The Miyazaki prefectural government said that its own sanitary officials were only able to check one-fourth of the 984 poultry farms with 100 chickens or more last year due to a shortage of staff.",
