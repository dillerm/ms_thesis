	"content_1": "International researchers have ruled out the theory that migratory birds were responsible for spreading bird flu in India. All samples from migratory birds tested negative for H5N1. Researchers also used satellites to follow the northward path of migratory birds and found that their locations were not related to the locations of bird flu outbreaks.",

	"content_3": "A workshop held on April 11 by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and the General Authority for Veterinary Services determined that only 36 percent of the 300 million birds on rural farms are protected from bird flu by vaccines. \"The amount of vaccinations is barely sufficient to cover the workforce that will distribute them and the responsive farmers who are willing to vaccinate their birds,\" Saber Abdel Aziz, head of the epidemic and poultry diseases at the General Authority for Veterinary Services, told Daily News Egypt. Participants say that 600 million vaccines would be needed to adequately cover poultry but the authority can only afford to produce 120 million. They also criticized the lack of funding for qualified veterinarians, only 1,200 when 5,000 are needed, and necessary equipment. There have also been problems in Egypt with unresponsive farmers who are not sufficiently informed about the risks of bird flu.",

	"content_5": "Bird flu continues to spread in Riau following the death of a child in late March. There were reports of poultry in the area dying abruptly on April 4. \"After checking by a team of veterinarians, two of the chickens tested positive for bird flu. A day earlier, we received reports that 12 chickens owned by other residents had died suddenly,\" Indra Atmaja told The Jakarta Post. The bird flu has spread to the neighboring villages of Teluk Masjid and Teluk Batil. Village chiefs are raising awareness of the disease and a team from the Siak Animal Husbandry agency sprayed the poultry cages with disinfectant to prevent the disease from spreading. Residents are encouraged to cull their poultry but many are unwilling since the district office does not have a budget to compensate them for dead birds."
