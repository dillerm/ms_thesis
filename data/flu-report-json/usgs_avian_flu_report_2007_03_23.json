The bird was found sick on January 4 and died soon afterwards.  Investigations on the pathogenicity of the virus and an analysis of  its phylogenetic origin are underway.  If confirmed to be highly pathogenic, this infection preceeded the first outbreak in poultry reported on January 13.  The eagle was found less than 75 km from three of the four 2007 outbreaks.
