He had possible contact with dead ducks, and had buried \"by hand scores of his birds that had suddenly died.\"  A 37-year-old woman from Serpong town, on the outskirts of Tangerang, was hospitalized and diagnosed with H5N1 on January 8, 2007.  The possible source of her infection is under investigation.  She is known to have recently purchased a chicken and killed it at home. These two are Indonesia's 75th and 76th human cases.",

	"content_4": "China reported its first H5N1 case in almost six months: a 37-year-old farmer from the eastern province of Anhui who kept backyard chickens. He developed symptoms on December 10, 2006, was admitted to the hospital on December 17, and was discharged on January 6, 2007, having fully recovered.  An initial test for H5N1 was negative, but H5N1 was detected on a second test and the results were immediately shared with the WHO.  Henk Bekedam, WHO’s China representative, noted that while there were no known H5N1 outbreaks in poultry where the man lived, it was possible for the farmer’s birds to be infected with H5N1 and not show any symptoms because improvements in poultry vaccination rates in China could make it more difficult for authorities to detect a circulating virus. China’s last reported human case was from July 2006 in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the northwest.",

	"content_5": "The Korean Center of Disease Control and Prevention announced this week that a poultry worker was infected with H5N1 in the recent outbreaks in that country.  The person was not indentified and no details are available at this time, but the individual is said not to have developed any serious symptoms.  The individual was one of 26 residents living near the four affected farms who have been tested so far for antibodies to H5N1.  The testing of another 59 individuals, including farm owners and poultry workers, is not yet completed."
