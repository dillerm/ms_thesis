The Times of India reports that a source in the Indian animal husbandry department said \"...India and Bangladesh finally exchanged genetic information [regarding] H5N1 strains. We have found that both the strains are related. However, we can't say that Bangladesh was the cause of the outbreak in West Bengal because we don't have documented proof to show that infected poultry was smuggled into India.\"  Scientists requested information on the H5N1 strain from Bangladesh during an outbreak earlier this year, but it was not shared until this month.  It is unknown which of the viruses, from India or Bangladesh, was the primary cause of the outbreak in either location.",
