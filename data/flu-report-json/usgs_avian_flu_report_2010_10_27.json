The patient was treated in the internal medicine isolation unit of M Djamil hospital for four hours before her death. She had originally been admitted to Talu public health center, was transferred to Jambak Pasbar regional hospital, and then transferred again to M Djamil hospital because her condition was deteriorating. A lung examination done at the hospital showed pneumonia, which may be a sign of bird flu. M Djamil hospital collected the patient’s blood and throat swab samples for further examination at the Indonesia Ministry of Health Research and Development laboratory. Field investigation has found dead chickens near the patient’s house. However, those chickens had shown symptoms of convulsion, and did not die suddenly as birds with bird flu normally do. Three other patients, an eight-year-old, a nine-year-old, and a five-year-old, in Lampung are being treated for suspected bird flu. According to Abdoel Moeloek, director of the hospital, they were admitted on October 21 with symptoms such as high fever, coughing, and digestive trouble. The patients had recently been in contact with dead chickens that tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The hospital treated them with antibiotics and Tamiflu and took samples to test for bird flu. The patients are currently in good condition. A rapid test on a baby previously suspected of bird flu in Balikpapan came back negative for H5N1. Dr. Maurits, spokesman of the hospital, reports that the patient is in good condition, but will continue to be treated until the laboratory confirmation has come back from Jakarta."
