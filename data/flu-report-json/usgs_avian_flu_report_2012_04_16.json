Rapid tests on some of the birds were positive for H5N1 bird flu. The birds were culled but their owner was not arrested because he had not travelled on the bus. The birds were suspected of being intended for markets in Denpasar. Wahyu Savitri, the executive head of the Gilimanuk quarantine office, said that smuggling of poultry is rife in Bali and that three attempts have already been foiled this year. Bird flu has so far been detected nine districts and municipalities in Bali.",

	"content_2": ". A bird flu outbreak is suspected in back-yard poultry in a village in Gongdue, Mongar after 30-40 chicks were reported dead from nine houses last month. The deaths were reported to the department of livestock on March 27 and the samples are yet to be confirmed positive by the National Center for Animal Health in Serbithang, Thimphu. The symptoms of the chicks that died were similar to those of bird flu, but there are 260 unaffected birds in the village, so officials are waiting for test results to confirm the cause of death in the chicks. Officials from the regional livestock development centre in Kanglung and Mongar are in the field creating awareness and investigating the deaths.",
