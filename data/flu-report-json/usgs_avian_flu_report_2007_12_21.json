Hong Kong's Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department said the reserve will be closed for 21 days. The grey heron is a non-native species and migrates to Hong Kong in winter. In another occurrence, a common buzzard (a common visitor to Hong Kong) found dead on December 17 in Lantau has tested positive for H5N1. According to the Agriculture, Fisheries & Conservation Department, there are no chicken farms within 3 km of where the birds were found at either location.",
