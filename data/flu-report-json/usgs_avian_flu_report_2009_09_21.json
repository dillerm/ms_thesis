The Food Standards Agency said that the infected pigs pose no health threat to humans because the virus is not transmissible through pork. The chief veterinarian of Northern Ireland, Bert Houston, warned farmers infected with pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus to stay away from their pigs. Ulster Farmers Union President Graham Furey does not think that the incident will affect the pork industry. He added, \"People should understand that pigs can get sick just as humans do - in the vast majority of cases people recover from influenza in the same way as pigs. It may just mean the pig takes a fortnight longer to mature but there's no reason why these pigs should be put down - they should recover with time and a bit of care.\""
