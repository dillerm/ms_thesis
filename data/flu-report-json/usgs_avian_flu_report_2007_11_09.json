	"content_1": "In response to the suggestion that migratory birds were responsible for the introduction of HPAI H5N1 into Japan in January and Feburary 2007, researchers from the University of Tokyo analyzed the migration routes of Eurasian wigeon and mallards and found that they headed northeast over the Sea of Japan before entering Russia and not north over Korea, as previously suspected. The research, headed by Hiroyoshi Higuchi at the University of Tokyo, was the first to map the migratory routes of the birds in Japan. When HPAI H5N1 appeared in Japan earlier this year, many suspected that the virus may have been introduced by ducks from the Qinghai region of China, but Higuchi noted that not a single duck migrated into this region of China during the study. Birds from Miyazaki and Nagasaki prefectures were used in the study.",
