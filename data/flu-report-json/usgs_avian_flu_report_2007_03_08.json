	"content_1": "The discovery of a thirteenth bird infected with H5N1 in Hong Kong this year has prompted the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society to urge the Hong Kong government to ban the trade in wild birds.  Mike Kilburn, the vice-chairman of the Society, noted that 70% of the infected birds have been found within 3 km of the Mong Kok bird market, and that all infected birds found in 2006-2007 were either birds such as the scaly-breasted munia (Lonchura punctata) and silver-eared mesia (Leiothrix argentaurus), which are sold for religious release; or urban scavengers or predators such as magpies and goshawks which feed on sick or dead birds.  \"It's the confinement of traded birds in unhygienic and stressful conditions, and not concentrations of migratory birds, which represents the real risk of infection to the public,\" Kilburn said.  He further noted that thousands of wild birds have been tested for H5N1 at Mai Po refuge in the past two years, and none of the free-flying wild birds has tested positive for H5N1.  It is estimated that between 450,000 and 700,000 birds are imported each year into Hong Kong, and except for 40,000 to 80,000 that are checked, the majority are unregulated.",

	"content_2": "Twenty-four saker falcons (Falco cherrug), one kestrel (Falco tinnunculus), and a number of owls have died at Tehranâ€™s Pardisan Park.  The Iranian Veterinary Organization has collected samples for testing between February 23 to March 1, and at least one bird tested positive for avian influenza.  Further testing is in progress.  It was decided on March 6 that all birds at the park will be culled, but the operation has been postponed until final test results are known."
