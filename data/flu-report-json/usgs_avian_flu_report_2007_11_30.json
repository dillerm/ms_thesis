	"content_2": "Samples from a Saker Falcon  (Falco cherrug) have tested positive for H5N1 at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory in Dubai.  The falcon died, but according to the report, no post-mortem examination was performed. The falcon was part of a group of birds imported into the kingdom from Central Asia and reports suggest that “a large proportion of these falcons died showing similar symptoms.”  It is not clear at this time whether the falcons were infected in the wild or had been fed infected meats. In neighboring Bahain, the head of the Veterinary Section, Dr. Mohammed Aladin Ashour said that the threat of bird flu for Bahrain’s falcons is “at zero” and hunters can look forward to a healthy hunting season ahead.",
