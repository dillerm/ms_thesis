H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
The death of an eight-year-old boy from Bekasi on March 1 may be due to avian influenza. Family members reported that some chickens had died and were buried near his home. On the same day a six-year-old girl from Depok died at Persahabatan hospital. Doctors suspect bird flu because of her symptoms. Samples from both cases have been taken to Jakarta for testing to identify the cause of death. Bayu Krisnamurthi, the head of Indonesia’s national bird flu commission said four Indonesians died from avian influenza in January and February. Little additional information was provided and it is not clear if any of these four are cases that have previously been declared to the World Health Organisation. If all are confirmed as new, it will increase the country’s death toll from the disease to 119.
