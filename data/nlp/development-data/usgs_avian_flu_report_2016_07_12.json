	"content_2": "On July 8, 2016, Canadian officials reported that a low pathogenic subtype of the H5N2 avian influenza was detected on a commercial duck farm near the town of St Catharines in the province of Ontario.  30 birds were sampled on July 4, 2016 as part of pre-export testing. 15 of the samples tested positive for avian influenza and 14 for the H5 subtype by RT-PCR. Sequencing of a portion of the H5 hemagglutinin gene showed that the virus was most closely related to North American low pathogenic H5 avian influenza viruses of wild bird origin and not to the strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N2/H5N8 that affected the US and Canada last year. Chief CFIA veterinary officer Harpreet Kochhar said all 14,000 birds would be humanely killed and disposed of. The farm is under quarantine, and recent movements of birds and farm equipment onto and off the property are being tracked. A surveillance zone 3km in radius was established and all poultry operations within the zone have tested negative for avian influenza.",
