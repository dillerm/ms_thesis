H5N1 in Poultry in USA
Tyson Foods, the nation's second largest poultry producer, said that it has begun killing 15,000 chickens at a plant located in northwest Arkansas, following discovery of H7N3 in the flock. None of the birds showed signs of disease and the antibodies to the H7N3 virus were only detected during routine pre-slaughter testing, said the director of the stateâ€™s Livestock and Poultry Commission.
