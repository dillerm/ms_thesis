H5N1 in Poultry in Thailand
Following an announcement last week that H5N1 had been detected in the district of Thung Saliam, the deaths of 30 chickens, which died November 11th, were reported in nearby Sukhothai, Sawankhalok District. These mortalities sparked fears of bird flu spreading in the central province of Sukhothai. The birds were promptly buried and another 385 chickens from 28 households were rounded up in preparation for culling. Bird flu may also have been detected in a fighting cock farm, also in Sawankhalok District; none of the cock farm birds have died. According to the Bangkok Post, the fighting cocks were positively infected with bird flu but the strain has not yet been identified. Additional samples have been sent to a second laboratory for further testing. The Agriculture Ministry announced that H5N1 has been detected in a small flock of chickens at a family farm in the northern province of Uthai Thani. The birds began dying on November 3rd. This new outbreak is the fourth in Thailand this year and comes less than two days after the outbreak in Sukhothai was discovered.
