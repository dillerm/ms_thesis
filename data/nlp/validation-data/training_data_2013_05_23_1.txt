HPAI H7N3 in Poultry in Mexico
 Mexican authorities confirmed an outbreak of H7N3 at a farm in the town of Palmar de Bravo, in the state of Puebla, earlier this week.  After samples came back positive for the deadly virus, 55,000 birds at the infected farm were culled to prevent the disease from spreading further.  Additionally, The Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries and Food (SAGARPA) are collecting samples from farms throughout the state, distributing millions of doses of vaccines, and monitoring movement control.
