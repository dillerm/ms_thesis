An outbreak of pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus in piglets began December 22 on a commercial farm in Norfolk, England. 1,124 out of 2,004 animals on the farm were infected. The infected piglets were coughing but not lethargic. Most of them recovered fully but 3 were slaughtered for diagnostic purposes. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency is conducting an epidemiological investigation. The farm has instituted voluntary movement controls.
