France (HPAI H5N8)
The Agricultural Ministry of France is conducting another preemptive duck cull in the Landes department (southwestern France). Â Previously in January, 1.3 million birds were preemptively culled in three departments on a selective basis, but H5N8 outbreaks continue to occur. The ministry now plans to cull all remaining 600,000 ducks in the region.
