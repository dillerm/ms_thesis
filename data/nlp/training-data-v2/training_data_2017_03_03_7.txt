Taiwan (HPAI H5N6)
A news article dated February 20 reports that H5N6 avian influenza was found in a batch of 400 abandoned chicken carcasses in Hsinchu County, northern Taiwan.  This is the first case of H5N6 in Hsinchu County this year.  Authorities suspect that the dead chickens were dumped by a nearby farm. On February 18, officials confirmed several new cases of HPAI H5N6 avian influenza: outbreaks occurred at a goose farm in Chiayi County, among ducks in a slaughterhouse in Yilan County, and at a chicken farm in Yunlin County, where 22,000 chickens have been culled.  Transportation and slaughter of poultry was banned for seven days, starting on February 17.
