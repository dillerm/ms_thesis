Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports additional cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza viruses in poultry farms in the Edo, Lagos, and Kaduna states. Confirmation took place after tests run by the National Veterinary Research Institute Vom came back positive. A total of 3580 birds died, the remaining 8870 were culled to prevent further spread of the disease. All three states have implemented the following control measures: movement control; quarantine; disposal and destruction of animal products, carcasses, by-products and waste; modified stamping out; and prohibition of vaccination. Lagos and Edo have also utilized surveillance and disinfection to regulate the spread of the virus. The causes of these outbreaks are unknown, although poor biosecurity was noted at the Kaduna farm, and movement control mandates in the Lagos and Edo states have not been properly enforced.
