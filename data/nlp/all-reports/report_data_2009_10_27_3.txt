H5N1 in Wild birds in Ivory Coast
The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) confirmed on October 15 that the carcasses of white-backed ravens from Abidjan had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. Dr. Mel Eg Emmanuel, the representative of the FAO in the Ivory Coast, said that the birds were found dead in the yard of a French high school on October 6. He added that emergency measures such as closing the high school and disinfecting the entire area had been taken. A team from the National Institute for Public Health was monitoring 25 people, including 17 who directly touched the carcasses.
