H5N1 in Wild birds
The Sep 2 issue of FAO AIDE News reports that cold weather is a factor in the spread of H5N1 bird flu among wild birds. A direct relationship between cold weather and the disease was first established in 2006 when a cold spell in Europe coincided with an increase in H5N1 detection in wild birds. An FAO research team investigated to see if the geographic distribution of these infections was related to the long-term wintering line (a line marking the limit beyond which areas are unsuitable for wintering waterfowl) and found that the detection cites were closer to the line than would be expected by chance. The rationale is that wild birds are likely to congregate in water bodies with partial frost conditions, which enhances the transmission and local spread of the disease. These hotspots then build up environmental virus loads of H5N1 that can persist until spring in cooler areas. Their findings suggest that during anomalous cold weather periods could act as a warning for authorities to increase wild bird influenza surveillance in European wintering sites.
