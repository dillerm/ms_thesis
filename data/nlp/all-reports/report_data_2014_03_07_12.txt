Avian Influenza in Humans in Cambodia (HPAI H5N1).
On February 20, the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization confirmed the country’s third H5N1 case of the year. The victim, a four-year-old boy from Kratié Province, had been in contact with dead poultry six days before developing symptoms and is now “on the mend.” Earlier this year, about 350 birds died in the same village after contracting avian influenza. On 2/28/14, two additional H5N1 cases were reported from Kampong Cham province. Infection in two girls, aged 10 and 11 from different villages were confirmed. Both girls appeared to have had mild symptoms and have recovered.
