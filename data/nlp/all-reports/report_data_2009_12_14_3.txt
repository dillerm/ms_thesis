A second cat in Oregon has died from pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus after catching the virus from its owner. This cat, an 8-year-old female, had a history of allergies and sinusitis, which may have made it more susceptible to the flu. A 12-year-old female cat from Pennsylvania also recently died from H1N1 infection. According to the American Veterinary Medical association, cats in Utah, Colorado, Iowa, and France have also caught the virus. Veterinarians are concerned that cats may be more sensitive to the virus than humans and Emilio DeBess, public health veterinarian in Oregon, is working with researchers at the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory at Oregon State University to find out. In California, scientists are studying the case of Gijima, an 8-year-old cheetah that came down with pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus to determine how she caught the virus and how other zoo animals can be protected. Sharon Hietala, a professor and immunologist at the California Animal Health and Food Safety Laboratory System at UC Davis, heads a lab that tracks H1N1 in animals and is investigating the cheetah’s case. She said, “So as scientists we want to understand the transmission, how this happened and how we can protect other cats or other animals.” It is thought that Gijima caught the virus from an infected employee. She has fully recovered now and none of the other animals have shown symptoms.
