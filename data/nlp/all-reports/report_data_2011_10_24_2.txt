H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
 In relation to the H5N1 bird flu outbreaks on Lombok Island in Indonesia, four patients continue to be treated for possible bird flu infection at West Nusa Tenggara General Hospital in Central Lombok. Three of the patients are currently recovering, a 5-month-old baby, an 11-month-old boy and 53-year-old man, while the fourth patient, a 10-year-old girl, remains under close observation as she is still exhibiting flu symptoms.  All of the patientsâ€™ preliminary test results were negative for the H5N1 strain of bird flu, but doctors are waiting on further tests from Jakarta before clearing them to leave the hospital.  All of the patients live within one kilometer of each other in Central Lombok, an area that has been experiencing bird flu outbreaks among chickens for the past few weeks.
