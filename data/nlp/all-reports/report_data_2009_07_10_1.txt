The Canadian government and the Province of Saskatchewan are working closely together to determine the health risk from a new strain of flu that was detected in two workers on a hog farm in the province. Like the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, the new strain is a mix of genetic information from swine flu and human flu. However, the new strain is not a variation of the pandemic strain. The two workers have already recovered fully after suffering only mild illness. A third case is under investigation. According to Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, “Preliminary results indicate the risk to public health is low and that Canadians who have been vaccinated against the regular, seasonal flu should have some immunity to this new flu strain.” Initial testing of the pigs on the farms shows that they were infected with swine flu, but not with the new mixed strain. The Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is collaborating with Saskatchewan public heath officials on further surveillance of workers in Saskatchewan’s hog industry. PHAC will also provide field epidemiological assistance to Saskatchewan. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is providing advice to the province on swine herd surveillance and further diagnostic support at the national reference laboratory in Winnipeg.
