Taiwan (LPAI H5N2)
The Council of Agriculture of Taiwan detected a new outbreak of low pathogenic H5N2 on a duck farm in Hualien County earlier this month during a required second round of surveillance testing. Of the 13,000 susceptible birds, 20 were found to be infected with the virus. Surveillance around the area remains high and control measures being applied include quarantine, movement control, screening and zoning, and disinfection.
