H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
 Earlier this month, the Department of Livestock Services (DLS) culled more than 4,000 poultry infected with H5N1 bird flu at a farm in the Gazipur District of Bangladesh.  Other farms in the area are rumored to be affected by the bird flu virus but so far have remained unreported to the DLS. To combat further spreading of the disease, the Drug Administration in Bangladesh has authorized the importation of a bird flu vaccine, which will be administered in the Gazipur District before widespread application.  If successful in preventing further highly pathogenic avian influenza contamination, the vaccine will be applied nationwide.
