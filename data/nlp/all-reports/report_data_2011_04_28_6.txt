H5N1 in Poultry in USA
Nebraska Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Christin Kamm recently confirmed that a case of low pathogenic avian influenza was discovered at a recent bird sale, which was traced back to quarantined flocks of chickens, pheasants and quail in the southeast region of the state. Kamm said that the quarantined flocks are not part of commercial poultry operations. The birds were raised either for limited sales, personal consumption or county fair competitions.  State officials said they plan to slaughter the three flocks of birds in order to control the spread of the disease, but they emphasized that the type of bird flu found in these birds rarely affects humans.  All other birds within a two-mile radius of the affected flocks will be tested for the disease.
