H5N1 in Poultry in Togo
Local news sources reported on August 11 that H5N1 has been found in farms in three regions to the east of the capital Lome. This is the second time that H5N1 has been detected in Togo. In June,  H5N1 was found in dead chickens at a farm in Sigbehoue. Almost 8,000 birds were killed at the time to control the outbreak. The sale and movement of poultry in Togoâ€™s Maritime region, which includes the capital, Lome, have been banned in an effort to limit the spread of H5N1.
