Avian Influenza in Wild Animals
A total of 17 birds from a small-scale mortality event at Wiser Lake, Whatcom County, Washington have been tested at the USGS National Wildlife Health Center (NWHC). Four of these birds were positive for H5 avian influenza by RT-PCR and today, highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N2 and H5N8 have been confirmed in a northern pintail and a gyrfalcon by the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratories. The captive gyrfalcon had hunted in the same area and fed on a free-living wigeon. That bird subsequently died and the carcass was submitted to NWHC for testing. The northern pintail was among the mallards, American wigeon, northern shoveler, and trumpeter swan that died in the area. Wiser Lake has a history of aspergillus and lead poisoning. Aspergillus was present in at least five of the birds thus far, but the northern pintail was also infected with HPAI H5N2. According to the Scientific Task Force on Avian Influenza and Wild Birds, an expert panel co-convened by the United Nations Environment Programme/Convention on Migratory Species and the Food and Agriculture Organization, the attention regarding the role of wild birds in spreading highly pathogenic H5N8 could distract from effective disease control.  The Task Force said that regardless of the source of the introduction (wild birds or human-mediated), the focus should be on disease control actions at affected farms in order to prevent further spread.  The Task Force suggested that killing wild birds or spraying disinfectants on wild bird habitats are not advisable and such measures are contrary to conservation commitments accepted by Contracting Parties to both the Convention on Migratory Species and the Ramsar Convention.
