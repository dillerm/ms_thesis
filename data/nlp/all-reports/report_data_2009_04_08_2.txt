H5N1 in Poultry in India
The administration of North Dinajpur decided to cull around 14,000 birds in several villages after hundreds of birds died in the region and tests of samples at a Pune-based national laboratory confirmed bird flu in the area. Culling in the North Dinajpur district was scheduled to begin on March 30 but was halted for several hours by villagers demanding immediate compensation for their killed poultry. Culling restarted April 1 when the deputy director of the North Dinajpur animal husbandry department, Mr. Sajal Bhuniya, conceded to the villagersâ€™ demands. Bird flu was also detected at Taraganj Upazila town in Rangpur March 30, leading concerned authorities to take several measures to prevent the spread of the disease. Measures include spraying vehicles that enter the area, restricting the import of poultry and eggs, disseminating information to farm owners and the public, and monitoring poultry farms and zoos in the district. Officials say that the situation is under control and that no incidents of human infection have been reported in the area.
