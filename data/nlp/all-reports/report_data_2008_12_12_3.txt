H5N1 in Poultry in India
Bird flu has spread to additional areas in India early this week after an initial outbreak in over 600 birds was found in Kamrup District in early December. Official sources, quoted in the Assam Tribune, have reported that new cases of bird flu have been found in poultry from the Bejera area in Kamrup and in the village of Nilibari in Chirang District. "When asked for their observation on the rapid spread of the disease, experts here expressed doubt that migratory birds might have spread the virus of the disease, and in cases of the sites where wetlands are not located in the adjacent areas, the virus might have spread from the birds transported from the affected areas." Extensive culling of birds, numbering in the hundreds of thousands, has occurred in all the areas with identified cases, though it has been hard to contain the outbreak. "There have been some reports of people trying to shift the birds from infected areas to other places with the intention of disposing them of in the markets instead of taking Government compensation," said Assam veterinary and animal husbandry director Dr Ashwini Kataky.India will likely ask neighboring Bangladesh to help contain bird flu epidemic. According to the Financial Express, Indian authorities feel that the virus has likely entered the country from Bangladesh and has quickly spread to three districts in Assam, which directly borders Bangladesh. "We have asked the ministry of external affairs to take up the issue with Bangladesh for containing the spread of the deadly virus. We are members of the eight-nation body SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) and the region has to be free of bird flu virus and the cooperation of Bangladesh is absolutely necessary," said a senior official in the department of animal husbandry.A total of six districts in Assam have been affected by bird flu, including Barpeta, Chirang, Dibrugarh, Nalbari, Kamrup (Metro), and Kamrup (Rural) Districts.
