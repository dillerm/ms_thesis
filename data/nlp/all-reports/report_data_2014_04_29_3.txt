USA (LPAI H5)
The USDA Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) and the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) reported laboratory tests came back positive for H5 avian influenza on April 22.  The tests were initiated because a commercial Japanese quail layer flock was experiencing increased mortality.  The source of the outbreaks remains unknown and the 116,000 susceptible birds have been placed under quarantine in hopes to prevent the disease from spreading.
