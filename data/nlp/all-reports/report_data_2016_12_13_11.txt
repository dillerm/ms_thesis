Tunisia (HPAI H5)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5 in Ichkeul Natural Park, near Bizerte Governorate in northern Tunisia. On November 24, 17 common coots and 13 Eurasian wigeons were found dead.  On November 30, the laboratory of the Veterinary Research Institute in Tunis confirmed the presence of H5 virus in the samples taken on the animals. Control measures include movement control of wildlife reservoirs and surveillance within and outside of containment and/or protection zones. Vaccination is prohibited.  The cause of this outbreak is unknown at this time, but is thought to have been carried over by migrating birds because Tunis is a main migratory corridor for wild birds.
