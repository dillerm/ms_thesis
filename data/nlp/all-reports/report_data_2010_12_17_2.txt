There have been 171 cases of bird flu in humans since 2003. Since it was first detected in central Java in 2003, the disease has spread to 31 out of 33 provinces nationwide, caused more than $500 million in economic losses and disrupted the livelihoods of more than 10 million people who rely on poultry, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Many people in Indonesia do not seek medical attention in time and rely on traditional medicine. Intensive medical attention is required within the first 24-48 hours of reported symptoms to treat H5N1. Indonesia is comprised of 17,000 islands and has a population of 250 million people, making virus surveillance difficult.
