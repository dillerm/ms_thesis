H5N1 in Wild Birds
A nine-person team from the Crisis Management   Center (CMC), a joint program between the UN Food and Agriculture Organization   (FAO) and the Paris-based World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), has   arrived in South Korea to conduct an extensive epidemiological investigation   into the recent H5N1 outbreaks there. Since late November 2006, three outbreaks   have been reported in poultry, the first in almost 3 years.  “The team will be   looking at any wild bird deaths on infected farms or adjacent wetlands, as well   as collecting environmental samples that may lead to a better understanding of   disease emergence in the area.”  Results of the CMC investigations are expected   by the end of the week.
