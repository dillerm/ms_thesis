H5N1 in Poultry in Myanmar
Thousands of chickens have been culled in western Myanmar after health officials detected an outbreak of the H5N1 bird flu. Government newspapers announced the outbreak of the virus on January 17 and said that measures had been taken to curtail the spread, including a ban on the sale of chickens and eggs in Arakan state. Around 10 farms close to Lathamar village in Arakan state have been affected, although one farmer reported that all farms within a 1 km radius around the village must be treated. “Some of the farms there have around 2,000 chickens and some around 1,000,” said the farmer. “The chickens were killed and then buried in a six-foot deep hole in the ground. The farms were sprayed afterward.” He added that nearby farms are vaccinating their poultry in case the disease spreads.
