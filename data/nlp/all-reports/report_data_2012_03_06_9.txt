H5N1 in Humans in Vietnam
Binh Duong province has confirmed its first case of H5N1 bird flu in a human. The patient, a 22-year-old man, was brought to a local hospital with high fever and breathing trouble on February 17. He was transferred to Ho Chi Minh City Hospital for Infectious Diseases and Tropical Diseases on February 23 as his condition became worse. Blood samples confirmed H5N1 bird flu as the cause of illness. It is thought that the man caught the disease by eating a meal that contained duck blood. Those who had been in contact with him have been quarantined and his house has been disinfected with chemicals. The Animal Health Department raided shops in his hometown that were illegally trading in live poultry and slaughtering birds. They have also prepared 1.2 million doses of vaccine and plan to vaccinate birds against the virus. This is the fourth case of H5N1 bird flu in a human in Vietnam this year.
