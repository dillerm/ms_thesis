France (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has reported four additional cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in birds on commercial poultry farms and backyard flocks in the Dordogne and Haute-Vienne Departments. Of the nineteen birds confirmed to have the disease, twelve died, and another 15,021 birds were culled to prevent further spread of the disease. The National Reference Laboratory for Avian Influenza and Newcastle Disease confirmed the virus after testing samples from all four farms. In addition to culling the following precautions were utilized: movement control; screening; disinfection; traceability; surveillance; stamping out; disposal of all animal carcasses, by-products and waste; zoning; and prohibition of vaccination. Officials also plan to control nearby wildlife reservoirs, as the source of the outbreaks is unknown.
