UK (HPAI H5N8)
It was reported on May 5, 2017 that highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza has been detected in a flock of chickens in a backyard flock in Lancashire, England. The flock contained an estimated 30 chickens: many have died from the virus, and the remaining live birds will be culled.Â  The outbreak comes on the heels of the lifting of restrictions on free-rang birds being kept indoors. The farm is located near a previous outbreak among pheasants that resulted in the culling of 10,000 in late January, 2017.
