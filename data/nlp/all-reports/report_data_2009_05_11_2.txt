H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department of Hong Kong announced on May 2 that a feral pigeon found dead in Tuen Mun on April 27 had been confirmed positive for H5N1 bird flu. The spokesman urged people not to feed feral pigeons so that they would not congregate and cause environmental hygiene problems. He added that the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department and the Leisure and Cultural Services Department will continue to take stringent action against people who feed feral birds.
