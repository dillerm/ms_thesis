H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh.
An outbreak that began on Feb. 14 at a commercial farm in Dhaka led to the death of 164 birds and the culling of 1,036. Three birds from a backyard flock also died in the outbreak. Another commercial farm in Dhaka experienced an outbreak beginning on Feb. 16; 268 birds died and 1,182 were destroyed. A third outbreak on a commercial farm in Dhaka that began on Feb. 19 caused the death of 40 birds and the culling of 460. Since March 2007 around 570 farms, 50 of them backyard, have reported cases of bird flu. Although authorities are confident that this year will be better than last, scientists are concerned that backyard farms will be particularly at risk because owners are not well informed about preventative measures. Cases of bird flu in backyard farms often go unreported and pose a health threat to humans as well as poultry.
