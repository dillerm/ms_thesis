H5N1 in Wild Birds in Cambodia
 In the Takeo Province of Cambodia, the Phnom Tamao Zoo experienced an outbreak of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus among wild birds that gather and feed at the zooâ€™s ponds.  Between July 13 and July 18, a total of 19 birds were found dead, while another 10 were culled to prevent the spread of disease.  Although the source of the infection remains unknown, the National Veterinary Research Institute with cooperation from the Phnom Tamao Zoo Veterinary conducted an investigation of the zoo and surveillance in the nearby village from July 19 through 25. In addition, control measures, such as quarantine, movement control, zoning, disinfection, and dipping/spraying have been employed.
