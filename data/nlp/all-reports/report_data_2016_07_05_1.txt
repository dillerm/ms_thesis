China (H5N1)
Veterinary officials announced that H5N1 was detected in 2 African lions kept in a zoo in the Hubei province city of Ezhou. Testing was done at a military veterinary hospital. Testing was triggered by illness in two African lions who had high fevers. The male lion ultimately died, but the female has recovered. No similar illnesses have been seen in the zoo's other animals, but the the park's birds were vaccinated against H5N1. The detection is the first known H5N1 infection in lions, though China reported fatal infections in tigers in 2014 and 2015. Avian Influenza in Poultry
