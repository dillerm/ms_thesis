Two ducks tested positive for H5N1 from three ducks found dead at the Ismaninger reservoir near Munich, according to a spokesperson from the Friedrich Loeffler Institute. The third was found to have a milder strain of avian influenza. At least 14 other birds have been found dead in the area, but no information is presently available on whether they were infected with H5N1. The reservoir is an important site for waterfowl and is also a popular fishing spot.
