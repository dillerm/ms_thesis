H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
Thirteen villages in Ha Tinh, Ca Mau, Quang Tri, Nghe An, Nam Dinh, Soc Trang, and Kon Tum provinces are experiencing outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu. The outbreaks began between January 20 and February 13. From over 28,000 susceptible birds, 8,295 became ill, 6,033 have died, and 14,304 have been culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Possible sources of contamination include the introduction of new live animals, illegal movement of animals, or introduction of inanimate objects that might have carried the virus. Measures such as quarantine, movement control, disinfection of infected premises, and modified stamping out have already been implemented. Plans also exist to screen, zone, and vaccinate animals. Tests were run at the National Center for Veterinary Diagnosis and Regional Animal Health Office No. 7 and came back positive on February 13.
