H5N1 in Humans in Bangladesh
 Officials from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control, and Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh, are confirming that a one-year-old boy died of H5N1 on February 18, 2013.  Because the boy did not present with influenza-like or bird flu-like symptoms, throat and nasal samples were sent to the Center for Diseases Control in Atlanta, Georgia, and they confirmed the H151 virus on April 6th.  This is the countryâ€™s first human death from the deadly virus and officials are urging people to cook their chicken thoroughly, wash their hands after coming in contact with chickens and eggs, and for farmers to be diligent in following safety precautions.
