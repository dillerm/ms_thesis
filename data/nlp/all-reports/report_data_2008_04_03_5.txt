H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
It was confirmed on March 31 that the 15-year-old boy from West Java who died with bird-flu like symptoms was infected with H5N1. The boy had been treated for dengue at a smaller hospital for four days and died shortly after being admitted to the Hasan Sadikin Hospital. According to doctors at that hospital, the boy's younger brother had died of dengue a week ago. This was taken as conclusive evidence by some that this represents a cluster of bird flu cases in Sumatra. Nyoman Kandun, the director general of communicable disease at the health ministry, said chickens had died in that area. A 22-month-old girl from Bukit Tinggi in Sumatra has tested positive for bird flu. She fell ill on March 19, but her condition is said to be improving upon treatment at a hospital in Padang, according to the health ministry spokesman, Lily Sulistyowati. A third case involved an 11-year-old girl from Bekasi, near Jakarta, who died on March 28. She tested positive for bird flu. (more...)
