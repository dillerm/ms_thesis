H5N1 in Wild Birds in Kuwait:
Lawmakers in Kuwait’s parliament have charged that  birds, particularly falcons, illegally imported into Kuwait may have been the  cause of that country’s H5N1 outbreak.  Although a total import ban on  birds was imposed in 2005, it was relaxed in July 2006 to allow the import of  falcons.  Several Members of Parliament showed documentation of falcon  shipments in late 2006 and early 2007: birds imported without the required  quarantine procedures. Issues were raised as to whether undue accommodation was  given to certain importers.  Kuwait first reported an H5N1 outbreak on  February 25, when 20 birds, including 18 falcons, tested positive for H5N1.   A total of 2 million birds have been culled in an effort to control the  H5N1 outbreak in Kuwait.
