HPAI H5N8.
While humans have so far been unaffected by the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza, a new study shows that ferrets can become infected with the disease when given a large enough dose intra-tracheally. This raises some concern of future possible human infection, as ferrets have similar lung physiology and cough and sneeze when infected as humans do.
