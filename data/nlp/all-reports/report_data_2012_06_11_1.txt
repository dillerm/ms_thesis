H5N1 in Wild birds
US customs agents seized a live songbird that was discovered onboard a flight from Taiwan to Los Angeles. A flight attendant had caught the bird and handed it over to customs agents when the flight landed on May 27. Customs agents suspect that one of the passengers had been attempting to smuggle the bird but screening and X-raying of all passengers, crew, and carry-on bags found no other birds, droppings, or feathers. Officials warn that smuggling animals can spread dangerous diseases like bird flu into the US.
