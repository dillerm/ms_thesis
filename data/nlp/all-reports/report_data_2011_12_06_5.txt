H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
According to the local Agriculture and Rural Development Department, authorities instructed residents to cull a flock of more than 1,300 ducks and destroy over 9,800 eggs in Dak Lak Province because of infection with H5N1 bird flu. Agencies have sterilized the farm and surrounding areas and are closely monitoring the progress of the epidemic. A local report said that another nearby farmer had earlier noticed signs of the disease but did not report them to officials, instead destroying over 5,000 dead ducks himself. The farm that reported the outbreak had taken in 23 surviving ducks from the other farm, which caused the renewed outbreak.
