H5N1 in Humans
The World Health Organization (WHO) is aware of recent reports that a new strain of H5N1 bird flu is circulating among poultry in parts of Asia. The WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response system recognized the new strain or clade of the H5N1 virus in February 2011. This evolution of the H5N1 virus poses no increased risk to public health as influenza viruses constantly evolve, especially in areas where they circulate regularly in poultry. WHO routinely assesses the public health risk from all animal influenza viruses, and human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza infection remain rare events and occur in areas where humans might be exposed to infected birds or contaminated environments.
