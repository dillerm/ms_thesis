H5N1 in Wild birds in Saudi Arabia
Dr. Medammel Zubair, the first Asian scientist to be awarded a doctoral degree in falcon studies, has cautioned falcon owners in Saudi Arabia about the possibility of infecting their falcons by feeding them prey infected with bird flu. He notes: “Because many falcons in North America, Germany and the Gulf have died as a result of feeding on avian flu-infected birds and other prey, especially pigeons and quails.” The statement on the falcons becoming infected with bird flu from eating birds in North America is inaccurate.
