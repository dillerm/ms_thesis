Avian Influenza in Humans in China (LPAI H7N9).
Chinese health officials confirmed that a 61-year-old man from Jinan, the capital of Shandong province, died after contracting the H7N9 virus on May 27. The man was admitted to the hospital on May 11 with flu-like symptoms and died earlier this week of acute respiratory distress and organ failure. The victimâ€™s 33-year-old son was also confirmed to be infected with the H7N9 virus and is in critical condition. Details were not provided at this time as to whether this is a case of separate exposures to H7N9 or human-to-human transmission. In previous cases, the H7N9 virus has shown only limited ability to be transmitted between people. While no additional cases of H7N9 have been reported, those who came in close contact with either of the victims are being closely monitored.
