China (H9)
Chinese Medical Journal published a study reporting that the nucleic acid material from H9 avian influenza virus was found in samples taken from a live poultry market (LPM) in Guangxi. In addition to airborne detection, the same study showed that 699/1525 (45.8%) of environmental samples of cages, sewage and surfaces were positive for avian influenza virus. Of these, 20.0% were positive for H5 and 30.5% positive for H9. Previous studies have shown that LPMs were closely linked to infections of humans with H9N2, H5N1, and H7N9, while chickens have been directly shown to be infected with airborne H5N1 and H9N2. The researchers did not explain why only H9 was detected in the airborne samples but not H5. They advocated for active surveillance of LPMs as the markets plays an important role in the dissemination of avian influenza viruses and surveillance should be carried out as an early warning system for avian influenza outbreaks.
