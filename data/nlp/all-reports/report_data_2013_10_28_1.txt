Avian Influenza in Wild birds
In a recent report published in the scientific journal PLoS One, Dr. Bruce Kimball, a research chemist with the USDA reported that they successfully trained mice to “smell avian influenza in the feces of birds and humans.” Currently, it takes days and even weeks to collect lab samples and run cultures to determine if a bird has contracted the virus; and in humans, it can take weeks for symptoms to even become noticeable. The authors suggest this new development will expedite the process of identifying birds and humans that are infected with the virus.
