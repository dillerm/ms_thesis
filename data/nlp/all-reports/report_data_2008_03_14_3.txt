H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
Bird flu has spread to another district in eastern Bangladesh. A total of 47 out of 64 districts have been affected since the virus was first detected a year ago. In the past 10 days, 220 farms from 124 subdistricts have been affected. Bird flu is estimated to cost Bangladesh’s poultry sector $120 million each month, with almost 50% of the country’s farms closed and 2.5 million poultry workers laid off.
