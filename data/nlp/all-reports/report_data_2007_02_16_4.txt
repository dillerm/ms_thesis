H5N1 in Wild Birds in Russia:
Four cages containing 397 budgerigars were found by  border guards abandoned near railway tracks in the Orenburg region of Russia.   About half of the birds had died, probably from the cold, and the rest  have been destroyed.  The birds did not have veterinary health  certificates and are believed to have been thrown off a train by the  traffickers.  H5N1 has been reported at several locations in Russia this  year, and "contact with wild birds" have been listed in the official  report to the OIE.  However, these abandoned birds indicate that illegal  trade in pet and poultry might also be a possible route of introduction.
