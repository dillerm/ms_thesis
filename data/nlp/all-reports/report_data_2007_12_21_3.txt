H5N1 in Poultry in Germany
Two chickens have tested positive for H5N1 in Altglobsow in eastern Germany near Berlin. The chickens were part of a flock of nine, and after five of them died, two were sent for testing.  The remaining birds have been destroyed and a 3 km protection zone has been imposed. According to the OIE report, 10 birds in a backyard flock of 11 laying hens have died and the remaining bird destroyed. The International Herald Tribune reported that Germany had previously detected H5N1 in a domestic goose in November. Preliminary analysis of the genetic sequence of the virus indicates that it is related to the strains found previously in Germany.
