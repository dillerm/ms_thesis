H5N1   in Domestic Animals
A third   outbreak of HPAI within the same month has been reported in Gimje, North Cholla   province, South Korea. The farmer reported on 12/10/06 to the authorities that   over 1,000 quail died over a 4-day period. The farm raises over 290,000 quail.    Some experts and local farms suspect the disease might have spread along the   major local highway, Route 23, but an unnamed provincial official is quoted in a   Korean news report as saying “Quail are hardy birds, and it seems the infected   birds got the virus from migratory birds at the same time as the poultry in   Iksan and fell ill after the full incubation period of 21 days." Before the   movement of poultry from the farm was halted, over 100,000 quail eggs had been   sent to market. Quail eggs are not washed before sale and authorities fear the   fecal contamination might contain virus. Also, 15,000 young quail were sent to a   farm in Koksong, South Cholla on 12/9/06.  No evidence of disease has been   reported at Koksong; 360,000 poultry within 500 m of the Gimje farm will be   culled. So far, over a million birds have been or will be culled in the three   outbreaks this year in South Korea. The Veterinary Department in Vietnam announced that the country has not   had any H5N1 outbreaks for over a year. The last outbreak, according to the news   report, was 12/15/2005.
