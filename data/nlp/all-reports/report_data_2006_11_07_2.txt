H5N1 in Domestic Animals
A summary of the Nigerian HPAI H5N1 outbreaks (123 outbreaks in 14 states) was presented this week at a workshop in Enugu. The success of Vietnam in controlling bird flu is being examined as an example of an effective control program. Vietnam used a combination of farmer compensation, nation-wide vaccination, and prohibition of rearing poultry and wet markets in urban areas to combat H5N1.
