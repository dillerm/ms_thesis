H7N3 in Mexico
.The Servicio Nacional de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria (Senasica) of the United States of Mexico continue their monitoring and sampling of birds in the western state of Jalisco and surrounding areas of Mexico in response to the outbreak of the H7N3 avian influenza virus that was first detected back in June.  To date, 537 production units have been sampled.  A total of 64,498 samples have been taken from farms in the infected area with 44 testing positive for H7N3 isolates.  One wild bird has tested positive according to the report to OIE, but no further details was provided.  Since news of the outbreak in June, 22.3 million birds have been killed to help prevent further spread of the virus.  Additionally, 125.8 million doses of a booster vaccine have been distributed to at risk birds.  Officials hope to cease vaccinations in the next 60-90 days as no new avian flu cases have been reported in the past four weeks.
