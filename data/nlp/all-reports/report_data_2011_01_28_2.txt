H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
A spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department reported on January 21 that a large-billed crow found in Tai O, Lantau Island was positive for H5N1 bird flu. The carcass was collected on January 18 in a highly decomposed state and many tests were performed before bird flu was confirmed. The spokesman said the large-billed crow is a common resident bird in Hong Kong and there were no poultry farms within three kilometers of where the dead bird was found. All relevant government departments remain highly vigilant and are strictly enforcing preventive measures against avian influenza, such as reinforcing health education and striving to deter illegal imports of poultry and birds into Hong Kong.An oriental magpie robin (Copsychus saularis) found dead on Jan 17 at the Fairview Park was confirmed to be infected with H5N1. The species is also a common resident in Hong Kong. The on-going intensive surveillance of poultry farms, pet shops and poultry markets has not detected H5N1 in these sectors.
