USA (HPAI H5N1)
A recombinant H5N1 virus belonging to the same group as other recent highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5 viruses has been identified from a green-winged teal (Anas carolinensis) collected from a hunter-harvest surveillance project funded by the U.S. Geological Survey. The bird was sampled in Whatcom County, Washington, on December 29, 2014. On January 20, 2015, the USDA National Veterinary Services Laboratory confirmed identification of the EA/AM H5N1 virus as containing PB2, H5, NP, and MP RNA segments identical to the gyrfalcon H5N8 previously identified in Whatcom County and PB1, PA, N1, and NS RNA segments from North American low-pathogenic avian influenza viruses of wild bird origin.
