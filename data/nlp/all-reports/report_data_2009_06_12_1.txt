H5N1 in Wild Birds in Russia
A local source reports that one of the 58 birds, mostly little and great-crested grebes, which were found dead on the northern shore of Ubsu-Nur Lake in Tyva, tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza on June 6. Samples from the birds have reportedly been sent to a laboratory in Kemerovskaya Oblast on June 11. Quarantine has reportedly been established in a 50 km zone from the lake shore on Tyva's side. Reportedly, 3,749 birds died of AI on the same lake in 2006, according to an official from the Civil Defense and Emergency Situations Agency.
