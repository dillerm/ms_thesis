Avian Influenza in Animals in HPAI H5N8
A recent study published in the journal Science, by an international consortium of scientists from every country affected by clade 2.3.4.4 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus,Â  investigates how migration patterns of wild birds can help scientists predict where outbreaks of avian influenza might occur. Researchers focused on the distribution of H5N8 in 2014 and 2015and tracked its spread from South Korea to Europe, Japan, and North America. Combining epidemiological data from each country with distribution of domestic poultry, short and long distance wild bird migration patterns, the consortium found that the long distance spread was associated with bird migration followed by local and regional spread by other mechanisms.
