H3N2 Variant in Humans in United States
 The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) reported on August 9, 2012, that there have been 145 cases of human infection with the H3N2 variant swine flu since July 12, 2012.  This increase of confirmed cases is assumed to be the result of the exposure to infected pigs at farms, especially at state and county fairs. Increased reporting may also result from a change in the guidelines allowing local and state agencies to report of the detection of variant H3N2 rather than only the cases confirmed by the CDC.  Four states have been affected by the outbreak so far, with 113 of the confirmed cases in Indiana, 30 in Ohio, and one in both Hawaii and Illinois.  Additional cases, including additional states are to be expected as testing expands. Two people were hospitalized due to their illnesses, but are now home.  No one has died from H3N2 infections in 2011 or 2012.  Over 90% of the cases seen this year involved children.  The public should exercise caution when attending fairs and should take these steps to avoid infection:  wash hands, do not eat near or in pig pens, and avoid visibly ill animals.
