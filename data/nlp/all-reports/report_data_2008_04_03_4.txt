H5N1 in Humans in Hong Kong
Microbiologist and bird flu expert Yi Guan believes surveillance must be a long term effort and it has already prevented one pandemic. With proper surveillance, he said, the next pandemic can be stopped. "If proper surveillance is in place for animals and humans, yes, we can stop pandemic influenza forever. Not just for H5N1; it may also work for other subtypes of viruses," he said. "For disease control, surveillance must be a long term effort. You know where it is and you know it is coming, like a spark of fire you can extinguish it," Guan said. If it was not for all of the current surveillance for H5N1, Guan believes the pandemic would have already occurred.
