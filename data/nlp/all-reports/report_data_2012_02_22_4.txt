H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
Bird flu has broken out recently in Sunsari, Ilam, and Panchthar districts. According to the Livestock Service Office, samples sent to a London-based laboratory tested positive for H5N1 bird flu and the results were confirmed on February 5. Poultry farmers in the area had suspected bird flu several weeks earlier, but test results have not been released until now. As a result more than 3,000 chickens have died in Sunsari district. The government has urged everyone to maintain high alert in the areas within 3-km of the bird flu affected areas. A meeting of bird flu disease control technicians decided to cull birds, fix four border points around the infected areas, and request locals and all other stakeholders to close shops, schools and markets in the emergency-declared area.Bird flu (H5N1) was also confirmed in chickens on three farms in Jhapa district. The Central Animal Disease Research Laboratory in Kathmandu confirmed the presence of H5N1 bird flu after it tested samples from the dead birds. The District Bird flu Control Technical Committee declared those areas as 'crisis zone' on February 12. The corners of the zone will be identified and culling of birds within the area will begin soon.
