The Netherlands (H7)
The Dutch Ministry of Affairs confirmed an outbreak of H7 earlier this week on a poultry farm in the Friesland province of The Netherlands.  All 9,043 chickens were destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading further.  The source of the outbreak remains unknown, but the Dutch Ministry believes that “it’s probably a mild H7 version of the bird flu virus” which is not dangerous to humans.  Control measures being applied include stamping out, zoning, and disinfection of contaminated areas.  Additionally, a transport ban has been placed on poultry, eggs, and poultry manure around the infected farm.
