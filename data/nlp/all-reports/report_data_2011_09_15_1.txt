H5N1 in Wild birds in Philippines
The Environment Secretary in the Philippines, Ramon Paje, has warned the public away from touching birds as the bird flu virus can be transmitted through inhalation or contact with bird discharges or feces. This appeal was made due to the recent report by the Food and Agriculture Organization that there may be a resurgence of bird flu due to a mutant strain of the H5N1 virus in nearby China and Vietnam. The Environment Secretary also warned communities to stay away from dead birds and to report unusual wild bird deaths to the Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau, the Department of Environmental and Natural Resources, Department of Agriculture, and Department of Health. The ban on importing wild birds into the Philippines from bird-flu infected countries, begun in January 2004, remains in effect to help stem the introduction of the virus into the country. Philippines has consistently remained free of H5N1.
