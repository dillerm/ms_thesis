France (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports 8 outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 in southern France, in the towns of Almayrac, Monlezun, Lacapelle-Segalar, Beaumont sur l'Osse, Monbahus, Ibos, and Eauze.  The outbreaks occurred on November 25 (1), December 1 (6), and December 2 (1), and all involved duck farms (except for one unspecified poultry farm).  All ducks on the affected farms were destroyed, and a 3-km protection zone and a 10-km surveillance zone have been implemented around the affected farms.  Other control measures include screening, disinfection/disinfestation, and traceability.  The outbreak was caused by contact with wild species.
