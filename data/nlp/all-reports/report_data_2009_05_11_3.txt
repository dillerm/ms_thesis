H5N1 in Poultry in USA
State and federal authorities are responding to test results from the USDAâ€™s National Veterinary Services Laboratory that indicated exposure to the H7 strain of low pathogenic bird flu virus on two farms in Tennessee, one in Giles County and another in Lincoln County. The strain poses minimal risk to humans and is neither the highly pathogenic strain found in other countries nor is it related to the novel H1N1 flu virus. Officials with the Tennessee Department of Agriculture restricted the movement of birds on both farms. The two affected farms produce breeding stock for the poultry industry so no infected birds have entered the human food supply. All 15,000 birds at the Giles County location have been destroyed. Bird flu is not transmitted by the consumption of poultry meat or eggs that have been handled and prepared properly. Low pathogenic bird flu causes little if any illness and is typically not fatal to poultry. The Lincoln County farm tested positive one week after the Giles County farm, but no connection between the outbreaks has been discovered.
