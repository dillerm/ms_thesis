H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
Bird flu has been confirmed in the Vinh Long province according to Vietnamâ€™s Department of Animal Health. The bird flu broke out on a local farm May 5 and had killed 250 of the 1,100 ducks by May 12. Samples from the ducks were sent to the provincial animal health bureau and tested positive for H5N1 virus. Local authorities are culling the remaining ducks and taking other measures to prevent the spread of bird flu. Four provinces in Vietnam are currently experiencing outbreaks of bird flu (Thanh Hoa, Quang Ngai, Dong Thap, and Vinh Long).
