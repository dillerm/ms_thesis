H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
Four outbreaks of bird flu have been reported in five districts since late December according to Muhammad Salehuddin Khan, the director of Bangladesh's Fisheries and Live Stock Department.  In an acknowledgement of the lingering problem of bird flu in Bangladesh, Khan said the source of the current outbreaks is currently unknown, "but it may be due to germs of bird flu [that] remained, as we faced [a] huge outbreak last winter." The virus has been found in Kurigram, Gaibandha, Gazipur, Narsingdi, and Natore Districts, resulting in the culling of over 15,000 birds.  Since H5N1 was first discovered in March 2007, the virus has been detected in 46 of the country's 64 districts and 40% of the country's 150,000 poultry farms have been closed.
