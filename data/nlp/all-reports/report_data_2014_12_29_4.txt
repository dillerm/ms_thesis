USA (HPAI H5N8)
The USDA reported that the HPAI H5N8 strain of avian flu was discovered in an Oregon backyard poultry flock. The mixed flock of multiple species had access to a pond and a marsh, where wild birds frequented. On Tuesday, the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) banned Canadian birds and bird products originating in or transiting through the control zone in B.C. from crossing the border. The ban covers uncooked chicken, turkey, duck, or goose; raw eggs; live birds; hatching eggs; composted manure; and meat from hunter-harvested birds. Pet birds must have APHIS-approved health certificates and will be required to spend 30 days in quarantine. More information can be found online at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/wps/portal/aphis/home/
