The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) concluded on July 21 that two inspectors infected with the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus while investigating an H1N1 outbreak at a pig farm in Alberta did not follow safety procedures during the investigation. Officials reported that the employees took off their protective masks in the hog barn because they were “hot”, although the CFIA protocols state that the masks should stay in place during the entire investigation. A veterinarian and two inspectors were sent to the farm to test for H1N1, which was later confirmed. The agency has taken steps to ensure that its workers are trained and committed to following proper safety procedures.
