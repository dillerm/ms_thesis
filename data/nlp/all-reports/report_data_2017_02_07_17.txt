Avian Influenza in Humans in China (LPAI H7N9)
On 25 January, The New York Times published an article summarizing the current state of low-pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza in China.  So far in this season, China has reported more than 225 human cases of the disease, including two which may have involved human-to-human transmission.  The fatality rate from H7N9 is not yet knows for this season, but China’s four-year average is 39%.  Sampling has been conducted in live poultry markets in Guangdong Province, and 9% of swabs (usually taken from cages, sewage gutters, feeding troughs, and chopping and de-feathering machines) tested positive for H7N9 – a number that officials consider ‘substantial.’  Upcoming Lunar New Year activities, which often include travel and increased purchases of live poultry, may cause an increase in human cases of H7N9.
