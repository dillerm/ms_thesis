Canada (HPAI H5N2)
A small non-commercial poultry operation in Aldergrove, British Columbia has become the latest victim of an avian flu outbreak in the Fraser Valley. Eighty five birds at the Aldergrove location were destroyed over the weekend. Since the HPAI H5N2 virus was detected at a broiler/breeder farm in Chilliwack and a turkey farm in Abbotsford, a total of 12 sites have been affected and more than 240,000 birds have been killed with carbon dioxide gas and then composted to keep the deadly virus from spreading. There have been two other cases in the Langley area, resulting in the destruction of 53,000 table egg layers at one farm and 11,800 broilers/breeders at another. There have been no reports of H5N2 related illness in humans. The worst avian flu outbreak in Canada was recorded in 2004, affecting 42 commercial farms and 11 non-commercial operations in the Fraser Valley and leading to the destruction of 17 million birds. The virus has been detected in northern pintail ducks just across the border in Lynden, Wash.
