Germany (HPAI H5N5)
A news article dated January 26 reported that highly pathogenic H5N5 avian influenza has been found at a turkey farm in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, in northern Germany.  This is the first time that this strain has been found in poultry in Germany, although it has been found in wild birds in Germany and several other countries.  In this case, 15,000 turkeys have been culled at the affected farm.  The strain has also been found at two other units of that farm, which are located in different villages, and the turkeys at those locations will also be culled.
