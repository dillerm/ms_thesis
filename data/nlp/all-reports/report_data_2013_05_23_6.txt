China (LPAI H7N9)
On May 13, Xinhua reported that 3 more people had died from the new strain of H7N9 bird flu in China. This brings the total number of deaths from the disease to 35 and the total number of infections to 130. The report did not give details about the deaths, but did state that a new case of H7N9 had been found in east Jiangxi province. Nature's map of the H7N9 bird flu outbreaks was updated on May 14 to show the geographical expansion of the virus in mainland China in late April. The author, Declan Butler, noted that there was a lull in cases in early May and hypothesized that the drop in cases might reflect the success of control measures such as the closure of live bird markets, though he cautioned that it was possible the epidemic would resurface later. This update was likely written before the information reported by Xinhua on May 13 came out and does not include the 3 recent deaths.
