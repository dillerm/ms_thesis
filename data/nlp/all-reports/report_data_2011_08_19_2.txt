In the West Kalimantan province of Indonesia, a 70-year-old man has been treated for bird flu since August 11 at Abdul Azis hospital. According to the man’s family, the chickens he and several neighbors raised had died, and he had handled the dead chickens. Two months later, the man began to experience symptoms of bird flu, such as difficulty breathing and a fever, and was taken to the hospital. Dr. Dewa, spokesman for Abdul Azis hospital, confirmed this stating the patient developed a fever and coughing that lasted 4 days. Although the man’s condition has improved, he is still under observation and treatment at the hospital. Observation of the man’s contacts and neighborhood is also ongoing.
