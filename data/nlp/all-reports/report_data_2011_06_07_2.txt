Germany (LPAI)
Despite attempts to control the outbreak, low pathogenic H7 bird flu is spreading in North Rhine Westphalia. More than 50,000 birds have already been culled to prevent the disease from spreading (48,950 from three farms in Rietberg and 6,000 turkeys on a farm in Rheda-Wiedenbruck). The disease was first suspected on May 24. Other control measures such as control of wildlife reservoirs, quarantine, movement control, screening, zoning, and disinfection of the infected premises have also been applied.
