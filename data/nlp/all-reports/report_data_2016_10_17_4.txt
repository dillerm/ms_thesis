Indonesia (HPAI H5N1)
Authorities in Indonesia have reported new cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in the provinces of North Sulawesi and Bangka-Belitung. The disease has infected and killed chickens, ducks, and in the case of an outbreak in Kalapa in Bangka-Belitung, even pigs. In all cases, the identification is based on initial testing using dip-stick style tests and samples have been sent to laboratories for H5N1 confirmation. Indonesia is attempting to prevent spread of the disease by culling and burning the carcasses. The cause of these outbreaks is unknown.
