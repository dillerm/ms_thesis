H5N1 in Humans
A 9-year-old child was rumored on the Internet to be infected with H5N1 pneumonia and was hospitalized in the town of Rimouski in Quebec, Canada.  The rumor started when certain sites posted that "several independent sources reported the child had H5N1," but this was denied by by Dr. Patrick Dolce, the head of microbiology at the hospital in Rimouski.
