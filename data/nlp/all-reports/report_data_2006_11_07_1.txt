H5N1 in Wild Birds
Many countries are increasing their wild bird surveillance as fall migration begins. This week, testing of almost 1,000 wild birds in the northern province of Ilocos Norte in the Philippines supports that the country remains free of HPAI H5N1. Australia has tested an unspecified number of wild birds in the northern regions and has not detected any live influenza virus, including H5N1. A new round of monitoring of wild and domestic birds has begun in Azerbaijan with the cooperation of personnel from the Agriculture Ministry, Ministry of Ecology and Natural Resources, Society of Hunters, Zoology Institute, and State Veterinary Service.
