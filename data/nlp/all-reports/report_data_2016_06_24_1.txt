Russia (HPAI H5)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports of an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI H5) on June 17, in Ubsu-Nur, Ovyursky District, in the Republic of Tuva. The positive animals include four grey herons, one great crested grebe, six black-headed gulls, one common tern, four great cormorants, and one unidentified duck. Wild birds were shot and tested for avian influenza as part of a surveillance program. The total number of birds tested was not provided and the neuraminidase subtype was also not provided. Sequencing of a portion of the hemagglutinin gene indicated that the viruses belong to the clade 2.3.4.4, which is the same lineage as the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses found in Europe, Asia and North America in 2014/2015.
