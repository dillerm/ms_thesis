H5N1 in Poultry in Bhutan
 On February 23, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest announced an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in Chukha Dzongkhag. On February 24, a pair of birds tested positive for H5N1 and 51 chickens were culled. The movement of people and poultry in the area is being controlled by the Bhutan Agriculture and Food Regulatory Authority (BAFRA). In addition, a group of health experts are monitoring people in the affected areas and people have been asked to report the death of any poultry to BAFRA. This is the first time that H5N1 has been reported in Bhutan.  While the import of poultry had been banned by BAFRA in January, following an outbreak of bird flu in nearby West Bengal, a local newspaper article published the previous week had warned that monitoring has not been able to prevent poultry products from crossing the border and procedures for disinfection had yet to be established.
