H5N1 in Wild birds
On April 13, researchers for the United States government proposed that wild ducks  immune to the effects of H5N1 bird flu could be spreading the virus. Scientists from the US Geological Survey and the University of Tokyo discovered through satellite tracking that some northern pintail ducks flew from bird flu-infected areas in Japan to their nesting sites in Russia. The study does not prove that the pintails carried the H5N1 virus. H5N1 bird flu rarely infects humans, but is a dangerous disease. The World Health Organization had documented 493 cases and 292 deaths since 2003 when the disease first broke out.
