H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
 The Nepalese Central Veterinary Laboratory and the National Bird Disease Research Laboratory confirmed earlier this week that the highly pathogenic avian flu (H1N1) virus had been detected at two poultry farms in the Chitwan District and one farm in the Rupandehi District.  The first farm in Godrang of Bharatpur, one of the largest in Chitwan, lost 30,000 out of 70,000 birds to the virus while an additional 11,289 were culled to prevent the disease from spreading further.  The second infected farm in the nearby village Mangalpur, has culled 3,200 birds and destroyed chicken feed and eggs in hopes to stop the disease from spreading.  Chitwan produces over 60% of the chickens for the country so officials are urging farmers to take necessary safety precautions.  The H1N1 virus was also confirmed at a farm in the Rupandehi District, where over 300 birds were destroyed after the Centre Veterinary Laboratory in Kathmandu confirmed the virus.
