South Korea (HPAI H5N6)
The highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N6 has been detected in wild bird fecal samples collected on the shores of the Bonggang Stream, Cheonan City in South Chungcheong province. Sequencing of the virus has shown that it is similar to H5N6 previously isolated from a white heron in Hong Kong. This is the first time HPAI H5N6 has been found in South Korea,Â  previously the virus was only found in China, Vietnam and Laos. The virus has been isolated from wild birds, poultry, cats and pigs and is known to infect people and is associated with at least one death.
