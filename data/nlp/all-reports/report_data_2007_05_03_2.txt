H5N1 in Wild Birds in USA
Phil Bruner from Brigham Young University and O. W. Johnson of Montana State University are among the shorebird experts participating in a multi-agency program to monitor for H5N1 in Hawaiian shorebirds. Samples from ruddy turnstones that migrate from Asia through Hawaii on their way to Alaska will be collected; in addition, satellite transmitters will be placed on Pacific golden plovers as part of the program.
