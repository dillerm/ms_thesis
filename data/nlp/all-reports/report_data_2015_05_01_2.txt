Minnesota (HPAI H5N2)
A Cooperâ€™s hawk found dead in Yellow Medicine County is the first wild bird in the state to test positive for the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus.  The bird is believed to have contracted the virus through eating infected bird, but although wild waterfowls such as dabbling ducks and goose are known capable of being infected with the virus, they are usually too large for a Coopers hawk, whose normal prey are small passerines.  Scientists say the discovery of the hawk does not indicate that wild birds are the direct cause of avian influenza in poultry, and Yellow Medicine County has not reported any cases of infected farms. The testing of 2,200 other wild bird samples collected this far this spring have been negative for the high path virus.
