Indonesia (HPAI H5N1)
Gorontolo Province's administration's quick response unit for infectious animal diseases culled thousands of chickens belonging to Gorontalo residents on October 25. This followed a suspected outbreak in which dozens of chickens in various parts of the province died, with the first case recorded on September 25 in Gorontalo City and spreading across the city and to Gorontalo regency and Bone Bolango. The quick response unit has culled 7,696 broiler chickens, free-range chickens, and quails since the end of September when it detected the first suspected cases. Three of the six regions in Gorontalo province are still declared free of suspected bird-flu cases: Boalemo regency, Pohuwato, and North Gorntalo.
