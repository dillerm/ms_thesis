H5N1 in Poultry in Bhutan
Last week in Thimphu, Bhutan, 49 chickens from 5 households were culled and buried after the National Centre for Animal Health confirmed they were infected with H5N1 bird flu. The birds began dying January 8 and officials were notified by residents a few days later, after they had already buried 9 dead birds. The source of the outbreak is thought to be wild birds or the spread of a similar outbreak of bird flu in Tshimasham. Officials sprayed disinfectant around the infected areas, and the lifted ban of imported poultry from India was re-imposed after a recent outbreak of bird flu in Orissa, India.
