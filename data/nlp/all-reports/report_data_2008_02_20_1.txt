H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
A grey heron - a common wintering bird in Hong Kong - found dead in Lok Ma Chau on Feb. 8 tested positive for Â H5N1. Three commercial chicken farms are within 3 km of where the heron was found, but investigations have revealed no unusual mortality on the premises. Additionally, an oriental magpie robin, another common species in Hong Kong, has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza. The bird was found on Feb. 10 at the Cheung Sha Wan Wholesale Food Market , which is located next to the Temporary Wholesale Poultry Market, one of the government designated and operated poultry markets set up as part of a control program after the bird flu outbreaks in 2003. Both locations have been closed for cleaning and disinfection. This is the fourth bird found positive for H5N1 this year in the territories.
