H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 21 year-old woman has died of bird flu in East Java. The woman was hospitalized with a high fever and breathing difficulties, leading the medical team at Dr. Soetomo General Hospital to suspect bird flu initially, but because the woman had no contact with poultry, the theory was initially discounted. However, tests later confirmed the H5N1 virus from a blood sample taken before her death.
