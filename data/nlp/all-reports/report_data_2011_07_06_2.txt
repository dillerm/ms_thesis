H5N1 in Poultry in Germany (LPAI)
Low pathogenic bird flu continues to spread in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia. One farm of 5,372 reported 3 cases on June 22 and one farm of 20,260 birds reported 12 cases on June 23. The disease has also spread to Saxony where one farm of 1,470 birds reported 2 cases on June 24 and three farms housing a combined total of 236 birds each reported one case on June 28. One of the sick birds from Saxony died of the disease. All of the remaining 27,337 birds from the farms in North Rhine-Westphalia and Saxony were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Other control measures applied include control of wildlife reservoirs, quarantine, movement control, screening, zoning, and disinfection of the premises. It is thought that the disease is being spread through the legal movement of animals prior to detection.
