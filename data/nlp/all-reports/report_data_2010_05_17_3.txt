Two emus from a small zoo in Kibbutz Ein Gediwere confirmed positive for H5N1 bird flu on May 6: one became ill on April 29 and died May 1, the other fell ill on May 2 and died May 4. As a precaution all other birds in the menagerie have been culled and buried on the spot, including 1 other emu, 2 quails, 20 peacocks, 70 finches, 20 cockatiels and 2 chickens. There were no commercial birds within a 10-kilometer radius of the outbreak. The source of the infection is unknown. Additional control measures applied include quarantine, movement control, screening, and zoning. There are plans to disinfect the premises in order to prevent the spread of the disease. Tests were conducted at the Southern Avian Diseases Laboratory and the Avian and Fishes Disease Division, Kimron Veterinary Institute.
