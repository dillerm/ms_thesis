China (LPAI H7N9)
Researchers warn that the highly pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza virus is fast-mutating and could cause a pandemic.  At least 48 different sub-types have been discovered through genome sequencing.  This genetic diversity can increase the virus?s ability to spread among humans, although there has been no evidence yet of sustained human-to-human transmission which is a prerequisite for pandemic spread.  H7N9 can spread from birds to humans more easily than the H5N1 strain, which has infected 784 people in 16 countries with 492 deaths since its appearance in 2003, whereas H7N9 has infected 596 persons since its emergence two years ago.
