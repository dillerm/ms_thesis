H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
A dead house crow found in Sham Shui Po Park has tested positive for H5N1. "House crows are common in Hong Kong. We have no idea if it came from elsewhere, [or] how it was infected," said a spokeswoman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. The bird, found in a garbage bin on October 15, marks the reappearance of bird flu in Hong Kong and could be an indicator of virus activity in mainland China.
