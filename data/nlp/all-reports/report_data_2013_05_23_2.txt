In the capital district of Kathmandu, about 1,665 birds were culled to prevent further spread of the disease.  Additionally, in the Kaski District, 555 chickens and their feed were destroyed after a farm tested positive for the virus.  Officials are monitoring poultry coming in and out of the country and are testing any suspicious looking birds.  Officials are urging farmers to take proper care of their birds and to contact their vet immediately if they have any suspicions.
