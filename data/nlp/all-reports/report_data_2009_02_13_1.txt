H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
A dead gray heron, found Feb. 2 in the Mai Po Nature Reserve, has tested positive for avian influenza. Hong Kong has decided to close the reserve for 21 days as a precautionary measure. A peregrine falcon found dead on Feb. 3 at Yau Kam Tau, in Kowloon, has tested positive for H5N1 according to the Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department. A large-billed crow found dead on Feb. 5 at Ancient Kiln Park on Lantau Island has tested positive for H5N1. A total of 33 dead birds have been found since Jan. 29 and 12 birds have now tested positive for H5N1. Testing has yet to be completed in another 22 birds.  According to the Associated Press, “The birds were mostly discovered on outlying Lantau Island, suspected of having drifted into Hong Kong waters from the nearby Pearl River Delta in mainland China.”
