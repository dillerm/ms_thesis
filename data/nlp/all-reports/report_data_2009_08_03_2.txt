Another case of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has been confirmed in a swine herd, this time in Quebec, Canada. The case was identified July 24 by the labs of the National Centre for Foreign Animal Disease in Winnipeg. The pigs are now completely recovered. The first clinical signs of the flu were detected in the herd at the end of June. Although it is not officially known how the H1N1 strain made it into the herd, it is suspected that in came in through a human carrier. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) has said that hog herds found to carry the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus will not be quarantined. However, the CFIA has said that H1N1 monitoring standards will be modified to limit the spread of disease to pigs and other susceptible animals. This includes requiring pork slaughter plants to have multiple inspection points to ensure that only healthy animals enter the food supply. Also, herds in which the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus has been detected will be more closely monitored to verify that infected hogs have recovered.
