Avian Influenza in Humans in Cambodia
The World Health Organization and Cambodian Health Ministry confirmed earlier this week that a three-year-old boy from Cambodia’s eastern Prey Veng province died of H5N1, bringing the number of human deaths to five and total human cases to 14. The source of the outbreak remains unknown, however, the boy’s doctors believe that exposure to the virus most likely came from coming in contact with sick or dead poultry from the village. Health officials are urging parents to keep their children away from sick or dead birds and to wash their hands often.
