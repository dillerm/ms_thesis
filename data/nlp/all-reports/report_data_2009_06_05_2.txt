The outbreak of avian influenza that began on May 20 in Western Bengal and killed twenty backyard poultry was confirmed on May 25 as the most virulent strain of H5N1. The samples were tested by the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal and the National Institute of Virology in Pune. The Animal Husbandry Department announced the outbreak formally on May 28 and added that measures such as curbs on the movement of poultry products, screening and culling of domestic poultry in a 3 km radius around the outbreak spots have already been taken. No birds have been vaccinated or treated, but contaminated areas have been disinfected. A further outbreak in North Dinajpur was detected after the death of about 300 backyard chickens. Samples were sent to the High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal and bird flu was confirmed. The district administration decided to cull more than 14,000 birds in area villages. They are also visiting local people to check their health.
