Uganda (“bird flu”)
The Ministry of Agriculture is surveilling the districts of Budaka and Kirsoro following unconfirmed reports of avian influenza in wild birds. These suspected outbreaks come after an outbreak that killed over 1,200 wild birds in the vicinity of Lake Victoria. Officials are implementing an awareness campaign and increasing surveillance in the country. There has been no confirmation or further details besides an initial report.
