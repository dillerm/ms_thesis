H5N1 in Poultry in South Africa (HPA H5N2)
In the West Cape Province of South Africa, 360 ostriches will be culled this week as part of an ongoing attempt to prevent the spread of the H5N2 bird flu in the Oudtshoorn area. Ninety-two of the birds had tested positive for the H5N2 virus on February 21, 2012.  More than 40,000 commercially farmed ostriches have been culled since March of last year, crippling a once profitable industry. Methods currently in place to combat the outbreak include: quarantine, disinfection, and screening of ostriches. If this region remains virus free for three months, the South African Agricultural Department can petition the European Union (EU) to lift the current ban on ostrich imports to the EU.
