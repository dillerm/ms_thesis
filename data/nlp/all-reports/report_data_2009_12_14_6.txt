Pigs on a commercial farm in Northern Ireland came down with pandemic H1N1 (2009) on December 2. The farm holds 2,000 pigs, 58 of which showed clinical signs such as lethargy and loss of appetite. Tests by the Veterinary Sciences Division in Stormont and the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge confirmed H1N1. The disease was discovered as part of an incidental investigation following the outbreak of another disease; investigations continue. The origin of the outbreak is unknown. One sow was slaughtered for diagnostic purposes, but the rest of the animals were treated with antibiotics and have recovered fully.
