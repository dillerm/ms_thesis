Russia (HPAI H5)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Russia.  Both occurred on November 7, in Yashaltinsky district, Kalmykia province, southwestern Russia.  In both cases, flocks of mixed backyard birds were involved; 95 of 122 birds died at one location, and 137 of 203 birds at the other.  While the neuraminidase subtype has yet to be determined, the H5 hemagglutinin gene was shown to belong to clade 2.3.4.4, which is the same as other H5N8 viruses currently circulating in Europe and elsewhere. Control measures are in place, and include movement control inside the country, disinfection/disinfestation, screening, quarantine, stamping out, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, and control of wildlife reservoirs.
