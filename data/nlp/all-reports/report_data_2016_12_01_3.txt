Japan (HPAI H5N6)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports two cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N6) in Akita Prefecture in, northern Japan.  On November 15, a black swan was found dead at a zoo in Akita, Akita Prefecture; on November 17, a second black swan was found dead at the same zoo.  The first swan was reported in the previous issue of AI News (November 18), but the virus had not been characterized at that time.  Testing was conducted at the OIE Reference Laboratory at Hokkaido University, and the swans were confirmed positive for H5N6 on November 21.  The origin of the outbreak is unknown; screening was instituted as a control measure.  Because of this and other recent reports of HPAI H5 and H5N6 in Japan and South Korea, Japan has raised its Avian Flu Alert to Level 3.
