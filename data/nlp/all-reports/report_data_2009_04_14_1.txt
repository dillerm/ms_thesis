H5N1 in Wild birds in Japan
According to a joint study by Tokyo University and Yamaguchi University, ten wild raccoons have antibodies from previous infections with H5N1 bird flu. These are the first mammals in Japan to test positive for bird flu antibodies. Researchers are concerned that infected raccoons could introduce the virus into poultry farms and suggest that countermeasures should be taken. The team tested blood from 998 raccoons from locations in Japan; the ten raccoons that tested positive came from three locations, two of which had no previous record of bird flu.
