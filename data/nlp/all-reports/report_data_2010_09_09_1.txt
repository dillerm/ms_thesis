Finland (H1N1)
An outbreak of H1N1 influenza began on August 23 on a fattening farm in Länsi- ja Sisä-Suomi. Of the farm’s 1,500 pigs, 150 showed symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, fever, and loss of appetite. Testing by the Finnish Food Safety Authority showed that H1N1 was the cause of illness. Officials are controlling the movement of swine within the country and screening animals to prevent the spread of the disease. It is not known how the pigs became infected with the disease.
