USA (HPAI H5N2)
Avian influenza has been discovered in a backyard flock of ducks, chickens, and geese in Clallam County, Washington.  All 118 birds were destroyed.  Officials plan to place a ban on the movement of eggs within a 6-mile radius of the area, with inspectors going door-to-door looking for sick or dead birds.  The virus was previously found in Whatcom and Benton counties.
