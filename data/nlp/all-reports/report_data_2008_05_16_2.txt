H5N1 in Poultry in India
One hundred chickens died in a backyard farm in Kursong a week ago and testing at a lab in Bhopal has confirmed H5N1, West Bengalâ€™s Animal Resources Development Minister said. Kursong is in the tea-growing district of Darjeeling near the town of Siliguri. This is the 15th district in West Bengal to be affected in the current outbreak, which suggests that despite the culling of over 400,000 birds in an effort to stem the bird flu outbreak in India, re-introductions or pockets of infected birds might still persist.
