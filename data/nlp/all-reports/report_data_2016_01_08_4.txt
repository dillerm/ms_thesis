Taiwan (HPAI H5N2)
The Chiayi County Livestock Disease Control Center and the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) have reported multiple cases of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus in poultry farms in the counties of Changhua, Chiayi, Pingtung, and Yunlin; and Taipei City. The disease was confirmed after samples from all affected farms were sent to the Animal Health Research Institute. A total of 7,250 birds died, and the remaining 34,944 were culled to prevent further spread of the virus. In addition to culling, the following measures were taken: movement control; screening; disinfection; quarantine, stamping out, and zoning. The source of these outbreaks is unknown. The Chiayi County Center reminded farmers to report any abnormal signs or deaths to the authorities immediately. Failure to report an infectious disease can lead to a fine and lack of compensation for any culled animal under Taiwan?s Statute for Prevention and Control of Infectious Animal Disease.
