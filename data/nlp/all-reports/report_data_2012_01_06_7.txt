H5N1 in Humans in Zimbabwe
 A senator for the Movement for Democratic Change party in Zimbabwe was reported to have died last week from bird flu by a family spokesperson.  Gladys Gombami-Dube, 48, died at a hospital in Kadoma where she was admitted after experiencing disorientation and dizziness.  This is disputed by the Health and Child Welfare Minister, Henry Madzorera, who states that the government has not raised any alerts of avian influenza outbreaks as there have been no reports of a possible epidemic or cases of bird flu in the country.  The family of the senator insists than post-mortem results indicated she had been infected with avian influenza.
