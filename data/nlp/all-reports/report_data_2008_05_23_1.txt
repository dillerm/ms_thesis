H5N1 in Wild birds in South Korea
The strain of H5N1 circulating in South Korea is different from that found in Korea in 2003 and 2006, but is almost identical to the H5N1 found in Japan this year, the National Veterinary Research Quarantine Service said. The genetic sequence of the H5N1 virus isolated from chickens in Gimje, South Korea, was 99.7% identical to a sample from swans in Akita prefecture in Japan. According to Kim Jae-hong at the Seoul National University, the finding supports the idea that the Korean outbreak may have originated from migratory birds on their way north after spending the winter in Southeast Asia.
