H5N1 in Poultry in Australia
Though close in proximity to Indonesia, where many bird flu related deaths have occurred, Australian veterinarian and Nobel Laureate Peter Doherty says that avian influenza is 'unlikely to reach Australia.'  Doherty's statement at the World Poultry Congress in Brisbane cites Australia's dry climate and geographic isolation as factors that will prevent the virus from entering the country, as will their strict quarantine system.  Australia also has active anti-poaching operations to keep neighboring countries from fishing illegally near its shores, including those that have confirmed cases of avian influenza.
