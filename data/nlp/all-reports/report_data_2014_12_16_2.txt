Canada (HPAI H5N2)
According to Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N2 virus has now been detected at 9 locations on 10 farms with over 233,800 birds dead or set to be destroyed.  The latest farm is an egg laying operation in Langley, British Columbia, which is within the Vancouver metropolitan area. Control measures such as quarantine and screening are in place.  In addition, eight countries have placed restrictions on poultry and poultry products from Canada.  The source of the virus in the outbreaks is unclear, although several of the farms had received chickens from a previously infected facility. Last Friday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency said that the complete genome of the H5N2 virus has been characterized and was found to contain 5 RNA segments from the Eurasian HPAI H5N8 and 3 segments from North American lineage avian influenza viruses. In particular, the H5 segment belongs to the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.6 lineage. HPAI H5N8 has been found in wild birds and poultry outbreaks in China, South Korea, Japan, Germany, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, and now one of its descendants has been found in Canada. It remains unclear where the HPAI H5N2 virus originated, but migratory birds may have had a role in the spread of the HPAI H5N8 in Asia and Europe and might play a similar role here.
