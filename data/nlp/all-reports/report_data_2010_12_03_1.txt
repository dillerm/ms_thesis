H5N1 in Wild birds in China
Researchers believe that captive rearing of bar-headed geese in China provides a possible scenario for the emergence of the Qinghai Clade 2.2 bird flu virus and its occurrence in wild birds. The first outbreak of H5N1 bird flu at Lake Qinghai occurred in 2005 and killed more than 6,000 birds, including more than 3,000 bar-headed geese. More outbreaks of bird flu all involving bar-headed geese occurred in the same area in 2006, 2007, 2009, and 2010. It has been reported that there was little domestic poultry production in the areas surrounding these outbreaks. The authors of a letter to the Journal of Wildlife Disease (see citation below) discovered that raising bar-headed geese in captivity was practiced extensively in this region of China, raising the possibility of contact with wild birds. Bar-headed geese have been raised in China since 2003 both for their meat and to supplement the declining wild population. The birds are often kept in close contact with domestic poultry and may have become infected with bird flu through them. At other times they graze outdoors with wild birds and could have transmitted the disease to wild flocks. The authors found no direct evidence that captive rearing of bar-headed geese was involved in the outbreaks in the Qinghai lake area, but they believe the possibility deserves scientific study.
