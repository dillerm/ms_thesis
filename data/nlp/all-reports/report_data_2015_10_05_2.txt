Taiwan (H6N1)
A unique strain of H6N1 has circulated in Taiwan since 1972 and the Taipei Times has reported that dogs are susceptible to the H6N1 strain of avian influenza, which was found for the first time in a 20-year-old café worker in 2013. Wang Ching-ho, a professor at the National Taiwan University School of Veterinary Science and colleagues found that some dogs sampled between 2013 to 2014 had been exposed to the virus. 1.1% of household dogs and 3.1% of free-roaming feral dogs had antibodies to the virus. In a paper that was published this year, the researchers went on to demonstrate that viable H6N1 virus was recovered from one of the dogs and was genetically similar to the virus isolated from the café worker, thus demonstrating the virus can infect dogs.
