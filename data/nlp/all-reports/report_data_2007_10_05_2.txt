H5N1 in Poultry in Canada
The Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) announced on September 27 that they had quarantined a farm in Saskatchewan where there was an outbreak of highly pathogenic H7N3 on a poultry farm. Officials culled 50,000 chickens using carbon dioxide gas. According to a CFIA news release from October 3, the bird carcasses are being buried in a remote area of the property approved for this purpose by provincial authorities. Normal decomposition of the bird carcass following burial effectively deactivates the avian influenza virus and respects provincial environmental regulations and internationally accepted disease control and biocontainment guidelines.
