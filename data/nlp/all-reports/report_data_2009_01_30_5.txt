H5N1 in Humans in China
Four cases of H5N1 in humans have been reported in Guizhou, Xinjiang and Guangxi Provinces over the past week.  In Guizhou Province, a 16 year-old boy died on January 20th after falling ill from having contact with poultry, and was hospitalized in Huaihua City on January 8th. A 29 year-old man fell ill on January 15th and is currently in critical condition in a hospital after being exposed to live poultry markets.In Xinjian Province, a 31 year-old woman died on January 23rd after reportedly visiting poultry markets and falling ill on January 10th. The Chinese Health Ministry said that these cases are all unrelated to each other.In Guangxi Province, an 18 year-old man died on January 26th of H5N1 after developing symptoms on January 19th.  He had contact with sick and dead poultry before becoming ill, and was transferred to a hospital in Yulin where he later died.  China totals five fatalities and seven known cases of H5N1 in humans this year.The Health Ministry, Agriculture Ministry and State Administration for Industry and Commerce has activated a system where provincial departments have to report every day on whether there is infection in their respective areas. However, the UN has said that the lack of poultry outbreaks in association with the human cases raises questions about the effectiveness of China's monitoring system. "If you have human cases here and there and you cannot relate them to a poultry outbreak," said Vincent Martin of UN's FAO. "You start wondering, 'Is it really working?'"
