H5N1 in Poultry in Cambodia
 Last month in two villages of the Banteay Meanchey province of Cambodia, 100 birds died from H5N1 bird flu.  To prevent the spread of disease, 22 ducks and 458 chickens were culled.  Control measures include movement control and disinfection of affected areas.  In addition, the Phnom Tamao Zoo in the Takeo province of Cambodia is maintaining quarantine around zoo ponds where outbreaks of bird flu killed 30 birds last month.  The area has been sprayed with disinfectant, several bird carcasses were sent to the National Veterinary Institute for testing, and zoo staff with the National Veterinary Institute spent two weeks surveying nearby villages for outbreaks to further prohibit the spread of disease.
