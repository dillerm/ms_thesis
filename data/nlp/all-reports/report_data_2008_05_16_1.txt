H5N1 in Wild birds in Japan
Another dead whooper swan found on May 5 near Lake Saroma in eastern Hokkaido has tested positive for H5N1 avian influenza, causing Japanese officials to worry that the virus may be spreading among wild birds in Northern Japan. This is the third H5N1 case this year; following earlier discoveries in five swans from two separate locations. Â All six swans, collected from three different locations in Akita and Hokkaido prefectures, were infected with the same H5N1 virus the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry said. Officials at the ministry believe all the birds were infected at the same place.
