H5N1 in Wild birds
A bird flu surveillance program in Azerbaijan began on November 1. Samples from 18 wild birds and 1,127 poultry representing different farms and private economies were tested. The study had participants from the State Veterinary Service, Ministries of Health, Ecology and Natural Resources, and the Hunters' Association. The Republican Veterinary Lab tested the samples and found no bird flu. Another monitoring effort will begin on December 13.
