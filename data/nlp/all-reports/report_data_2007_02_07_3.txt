H5N1 in Domestic Animals in Hungary:
Possible H5N1 in two goose farms was reported this week in Hungary. In Derekegyhaz, 9,400 geese at a  farm are being quarantined and thousands of goslings showing signs of bird flu  were culled. At Ordongos, 535 geese on a farm will be culled as some of the  geese showed "symptoms of nervous system disorders." Â No test  results from samples from either farm have been released but inspections of 29  other farms within 3 km have not detected additional cases of sick or dead  birds.Commenting on the discovery of H5N1 in domestic geese in Hungary last week, the  United Kingdom's Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said in its  report, "As it currently stands, continued monitoring of developments and  targeted surveillance of wild birds in the EU and the countries neighbouring the  EU are vital, as is the analysis of the accumulated data in order to better  understand the risks. Recent developments in the EU highlight that  surveillance, complemented with appropriate policy advice on biosecurity  measures proportionate to the risks are an effective way of detecting and  minimising the introduction of the virus into commercial poultry  operations."
