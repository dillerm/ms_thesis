Austria (HPAI H5N8)
The National Reference Laboratory of the Agency for Health and Food Security (AGES) is investigating an outbreak of H5N8 in Lake Constance in the state (Bundesland) of Vorarlberg where four heron and one pochard had died. Since then, more than 100 dead water birds (especially herons) have been found around Lake Constance. Control measures are still being decided but may include setting up a protection zone around the shore of the lake, stabling domestic poultry, and increased hygiene measures. The cause of this outbreak is listed as unknown.
