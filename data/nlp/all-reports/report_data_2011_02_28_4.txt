H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
Four outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu were recently reported to OIE. The outbreaks took place in villages in Ca Mau, Lang Son and Nam Dinh provinces and on one farm in Kon Tum province. A total of 2,874 birds died and an additional 3,657 were culled from a susceptible population of 8,011. The possible sources of the infection include fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.), illegal movement of animals, and the introduction of new live animals. Preventative measures such as quarantine, movement control, and disinfection of the premises have been enacted and there are plans to screen, zone, and vaccinate remaining birds. Infection with H5N1 was confirmed by the National Center for Veterinary Diagnosis.
