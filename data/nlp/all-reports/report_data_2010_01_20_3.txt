H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
The Livestock Service of South Lampung has announced a return of bird flu in the area. Three outbreaks of bird flu have occurred since the beginning of 2010, killing a total of 94 birds. According to the head of Animal Health and Veterinary Public Health of South Lampung, Agung Kusmartuti, the area is susceptible for bird flu transmission because it functions as a trading area with high activity and dense poultry movement. The Livestock Service has instituted control measures, including disinfection of chicken houses and raising public awareness. Seasonal effects may have caused the increase in bird flu prevalence, since this is the peak of the rainy season in Indonesia.
