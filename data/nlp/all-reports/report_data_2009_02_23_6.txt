H5N1 in Poultry in India
The North Dinajpur district administration has decided to launch culling operations in Narihat and Sardhia villages. The decision was made after the birds in the area were found to be infected with avian influenza virus in nearby Barmihar village. There are concerns of an avian influenza outbreak in the South Dinajpur district. In Baromahar village around 400 chickens showing symptoms of bird flu have died. Although blood tests have not yet been completed, officials are making preliminary arrangements for culling.
