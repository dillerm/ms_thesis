Avian Influenza in Dogs in South Korea (HPAI H5N8).
Eleven additional dogs from two farms have tested positive for exposure to HPAI H5N8. The two farms are 80 km and 195 km south of the capital Seoul, but are both in the same province as the location of the farm that reported the first H5N8 dog case on March 11. None of the dogs have shown any symptoms. The dogs are being tested to determine if they can still spread the virus.
