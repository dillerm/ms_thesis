Taiwan (LPAI)
The Defu market in New Taipei City was closed on March 23 after a sample collected from a chicken there tested positive for H5N2 bird flu. The Council of Agriculture is working to trace the origin of the chicken. The city government disinfected the market and neighboring areas within a 3-kilometer radius. Yilan County also reported a case of H5N2 from a duck market, but officials have not yet determined whether it was a highly pathogenic strain. More than 300 ducks at that market were culled and the ducks were traced back to a farm in Changhua that had gotten them from a farm in Yunlin County. The farm in Yunlin was empty, but officials disinfected it and the neighboring areas. They are inspecting other duck farms in Yunlin for signs of a bird flu outbreak.
