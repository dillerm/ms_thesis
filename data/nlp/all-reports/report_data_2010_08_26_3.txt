H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
There have been six outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in Vietnam since May 5. Two of the outbreaks occurred in Thai Nguyen, two in Dak Lak, one in Quang Nam, and one in Gia Lai. All except for the one in Gia Lai have been resolved. A total of 6,057 birds have been killed by the disease and 4,923 have been culled as a preventative measure. The source of the outbreaks may have been the introduction of new live animals, illegal movement of animals, or contaminated objects. Preventative measures such as quarantine, movement control, disinfection of the premises, and modified stamping out have been put in place.
