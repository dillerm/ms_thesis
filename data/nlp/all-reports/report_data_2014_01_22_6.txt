Avian Influenza in Humans in China (H7N9)
 The number of H7N9 cases in China continues to grow.  Last week alone, Mainland China confirmed 14 new cases, 11 within a two-day span, including two deaths - one from a woman from Zhejiang province and the other from a man from Hong Kong who contracted the virus after visiting the Mainland.  The majority of the new cases are being seen in H7N9 “hot spots” in eastern China: Guangdong province, Zhejiang province, and the city of Shanghai.  Of the most recent cases, six are men and five are women ranging in ages from 28-78.  As of January 17, five were in critical condition, two were in severe condition, and three were in stable condition. With the Chinese New Year celebration just around the corner, Chinese health officials are on high alert as travel around the country is expected to increase substantially.  In hopes to minimize the number of new avian influenza cases, health officials are urging people, especially the elderly, to limit their contact with poultry.  Additionally, Hong Kong announced that they would begin conducting blood tests on all imported poultry to determine if they have the virus.  Any birds that test positive will be destroyed as well as those that have been in contact with infected birds.
