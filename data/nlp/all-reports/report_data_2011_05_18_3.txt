H5N1 in Poultry in UK
On May 10, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) announced the launch of an EU-funded international networking project that will link thousands of scientists across the world. According to DEFRA, this project will allow scientists to exchange research, establish common goals and collaborate on developing future control measures for major diseases, such as avian flu, which are a cause for global concern. DEFRA said that the project would also serve to underpin early warning systems, by making it easier to detect emerging diseases in foreign countries that could pose a risk to the UK farming industry. UK Chief Veterinary Officer Nigel Gibbens said in a press release, “Global coordination of our animal disease research efforts will help ensure that new technologies, such as diagnostic tools, vaccines and new treatments, are identified and put to work as quickly as possible to make a real difference to the health, welfare and productivity of livestock.” The €1million network will include Canada, USA, Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Russia, Italy, Germany, France, Spain, Denmark and the UK.
