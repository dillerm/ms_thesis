H5N1 in Poultry in Nigeria
A new strain of bird flu reached Nigeria last week.  The avian influenza outbreak in three states, Kano, Kebbi and Katsina, caused the death of thousands of poultry.  Genetic analysis of the strain shows that it is closely related to the bird flu strains found in Italy, Afghanistan and Iran in 2007.  While bird flu itself is not new to Africa, this strain of bird flu has not previously been found there and its discovery raises questions about how it was introduced. "It seems to be unlikely that wild birds have carried the strain to Africa, since the last migration of wild birds from Europe and Central Asia to Africa occurred in September 2007 and this year?s southerly migration into Africa has not really started yet," the Food and Agriculture Organization's Scott Newman said.  Wildlife Conservation Society's Dr. Kristine Smith commented on Voice of America that "it?s not likely at all that wild birds played a role in this new outbreak."  She goes on to say that "it has been shown that this year's migration season has not yet begun," and "what we have suspected has caused most of the outbreaks has been through the movement of domestic poultry ? domestic chickens or domestic ducks. These animals are moved both legally and illegally within a nation and internationally, and that is how this disease spreads quite a bit." The bird deaths from last week's outbreak have caused neighboring Niger to place its country on 'high alert' as a precaution against further spreading the new strain of H5N1.
