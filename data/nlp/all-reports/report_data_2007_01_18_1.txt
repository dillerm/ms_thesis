H5N1 in Wild Birds
A scaly-breasted munia (Lonchura   punctulata) found dead on Dec 31, 2006, has tested positive for H5N1.  The   bird was one of five found dead on New Year’s Eve in Causeway Bay, a commercial   district in Hong Kong.  The scaly-breasted munia is not typically an urban bird,   prompting suggestions that it was either a pet bird released because it was ill   or that the bird was released as part of the practice of "merit release," the   Buddhist custom of releasing wild animals as good deeds.  It is estimated that   over 38,000 munias are imported into Hong Kong each year, most originating from   China.
