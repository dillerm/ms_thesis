Russia (HPAI H5N8)
Belaya Gora, Abyjsky District, Republic of Sakha (Yakutia). Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N8 was identified in a sample (trachea) from a hunter-shot Eurasian wigeon. Preliminary analysis suggests this H5N8 is similar to the HPAIV's identified in Asia and Europe based on the portions of the HA and NA genes sequenced so far. Further investigation of this HPAI virus including pathogenicity tests in chickens and full genome sequencing will be done. No HPAI H5N8 virus has been detected in poultry in the Russian Federation.
