H5N1 in Wild birds in South Africa
 Throughout June into early July, nine ostrich farms in the Western Cape Province of South Africa encountered outbreaks of H5N2 highly pathogenic avian influenza. The virus was detected through routine surveillance but tested negative on PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). Additional PCR tests were conducted and infection was then confirmed.  So far, 14 ostriches have been destroyed and an additional 1,186 have been slaughtered out of a total of 1,706 cases.  The source of the outbreaks remains unknown, but implemented control measures include stamping out, quarantine, and screening.
