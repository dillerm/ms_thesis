Germany (LPAI)
In July, in the German state of Lower Saxony, one farm experienced an outbreak of H7N7 low pathogenic avian influenza. A bird tested positive for the virus and all 190 birds were destroyed to hinder the spread of disease. The source of the outbreak remains unknown, and control measures including quarantine, movement control, screening, zoning, and disinfection have been implemented.
