Netherlands (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports four separate outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N8) in the Netherlands.  On November 11, ten wild birds were found dead in the village of Slootdorp, in North Holland Province in the northern Netherlands: species included the great black-backed gull, mew gull, black-headed gull, tufted duck, common shelduck, and common teal.  On November 14, four tufted ducks were found dead in the village of Werkendam, North Brabant Province, in the southern part of the country.  Also on that date, three unidentified ducks, geese, or swans (Anatidae) were found dead in the village of Oostzaan, North Holland Province, and one tufted duck was found dead in the village of Bergplas, South Holland Province (both provinces are in the midwestern part of the country).  In summary, HPAI H5N8 was confirmed in 18 wild birds (comprising at least six species of ducks and gulls), which were found dead in four different locations between November 11 and 14.  All testing was conducted by the Wageningen Bioveterinary Research in Lelystad, Flevoland Province.  The source of these outbreaks is unknown, and no control measures have been undertaken.
