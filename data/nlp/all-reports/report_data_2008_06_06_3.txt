H7 avian influenza was discovered at a farm with 25,000 free-range chickens in Oxfordshire. The family-run farm had been operating for 50 years and had a free range unit for five years. The farmer contacted the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) after his chickens exhibited signs of avian influenza. Tests are positive for H7 avian influenza, according to Nigel Gibbens, the chief veterinary officer. On June 4, DEFRA confirmed the virus as “highly pathogenic.” The outbreakis the fourth case of H7 in the UK since May 2006, but the outbreak nearBanbury is the first time the H7 strain was highly pathogenic.
