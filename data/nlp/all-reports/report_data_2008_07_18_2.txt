H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
Chickens from a farm in the Can Duoc district in Long An province near Ho Chi Ming City have tested positive for H5N1. Duong Minh Phi, the deputy head of the province's Veterinary Bureau, confirmed the presence of bird flu when dead chickens from the 3000 bird farm were tested. The farmer claims that the birds had been vaccinated, but Dinh Van The, the head of the province's Animal Health Department said "We suspect that the owner of the farm was not honest in his report, or the vaccine used at the farm was of bad quality." Long An is the second province in addition to Tra Vinh that is currently affected by bird flu in Vietnam.
