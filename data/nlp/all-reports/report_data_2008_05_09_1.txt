H5N1 in Wild birds in Japan
A swan found dead on April 24 has tested positive for H5N1, according to Japan's Environment Ministry. The bird was found in the town of Betsukai, on the Notsuke Peninsula on Hokkaido. Within a few days of the finding, close to 1,000 fecal samples, including swans and ducks, were collected on Hokkaido and around Lake Towada for testing. Authorities said that they have begun an inspection of five chicken farms within 30 km of where the dead swan was found. The case occurred less than a week after four swans tested positive for bird flu on the Island of Honshu.
