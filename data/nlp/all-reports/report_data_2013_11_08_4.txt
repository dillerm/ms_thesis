Avian Influenza in Humans in China (LPAI H7N9)
The National Health and Planning Commission of China and the World Health Organization confirmed two new cases of H7N9 earlier this week, bringing the total to four H7N9 cases reported so far this fall. The first victim, a three-year-old boy from Guangdong Province, is in stable condition and is expected to be released from the hospital in the near future. The second victim is a 64-year-old woman from Zhejiang Province. The woman is a farmer and has a history of contact with live poultry. She remains hospitalized and is in critical condition. To date, 139 cases of H7N9 have been confirmed; 45 resulting in death. Ben Cowling, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong’s school of public health, recently published a paper in the journal The Lancet “stating that H7N9 may follow a similar seasonal pattern to H5N1 bird flu, and predicted it would reappear this autumn and potentially cause a major epidemic this winter.” To help combat the disease, the Chinese government has increased surveillance and analysis of the epidemic, organized and distributed informational material to the public, and improved international communication to support cooperation.
