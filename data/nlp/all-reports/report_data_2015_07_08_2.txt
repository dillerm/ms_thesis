USA (HPAI H5N2)
Nine additional cases of the highly pathogenic H5, three of them further characterized as H5N2  avian influenza virus have been reported in Canadian geese collected by Michigan DNR in Macomb County, Michigan. They are likely to be additional birds from the same Sterling Heights location as the three goslings that were Michiganâ€™s first HPAI H5N2 cases.
