France (HPAI H5N9)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) issued an updated report following the detection of HPAI H5N9 on April 13 after 350 guinea fowls died over five days on a farm in the municipality of Labastide-Gabausse in the state of Tarn. On April 18, the National Reference Laboratory identified the strain as the highly pathogenic H5N9. The farm site also housed 2,800 free-range chickens which did not present clinical signs. All of the animals were destroyed to prevent spread of the disease. Other control measures include movement control inside the country, screening, disinfection/disinfestation, stamping out, and surveillance. The cause for this outbreak is unknown. This is the first time Tarn has been affected in the HPAI outbreak which began on November 2015 The OIE also notes that the farm housed a batch of 1,000 ducks that left the site for slaughtering on April 6 before the guinea fowl outbreak. According to the National Health Security Agency for Food, Environment and Labour (ANSES), the identified strains are of European origin and not pathogenic for humans. Given the non-transferable nature of the virus to humans, there is no reason for consumers to change their eating habits.
