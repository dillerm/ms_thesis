Macao (H7)
The Civic and Municipal Affairs Bureau (IACM) and the Health Bureau (SSM) have reported that chickens in a wholesale market have tested positive for a H7 avian influenza virus. All chickens at the stall were from Guangdong province, and had been sold before the test results were received. In response, sale of live poultry across Macao has been suspended for 3 days, all stalls in the market have been ordered to disinfect, and 15,000 other chickens from Guangdong were culled. Employees of the stall have been placed under a 10-day medical observation at the Conde de Sao Januario Hospital Centre.
