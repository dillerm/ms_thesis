UK (HPAI H7N7)
An outbreak last month at a poultry farm in Goosnargh in early July is now believed to have been caused by contact with wild birds infected with low pathogenic avian influenza which mutated to high pathogenic.  The outbreak led to the death of 34,604 birds and the culling of the remaining 145,261 birds.  A 3km protection zone initially placed around the farm has been lifted, but a 10 km surveillance zone is still in place.
