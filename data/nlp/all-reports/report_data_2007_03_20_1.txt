H5N1 in Wild Birds in China (Hong Kong):
Another wild bird in Hong Kong has tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu virus. A long-tailed shrike (Lanius schach) found dead on March 3 in the densely populated Hung Hom district was confirmed with the disease by the government's agriculture, fisheries and conservation department.  Biologists believe local species of wild birds found dead with the virus could have picked it up from contact with infected flocks in mainland China. The discovery of a thirteenth bird infected with H5N1 in Hong Kong this year has prompted the Hong Kong Bird Watching Society to urge the Hong Kong government to ban the trade in wild birds.
