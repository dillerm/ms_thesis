Hong Kong (H9N2)
 Chinese health officials confirmed that an 86-year-old man from Shenzhen who was traveling to Hong Kong was diagnosed with the H9N2 avian influenza virus, a strain that has not been seen in the country in four years.  The man was hospitalized on January 1 and is currently in stable condition.  While the source of the outbreak remains unknown, the man did frequent a market with a live poultry stall close to his home every day.  His family members and those who were in close contact with the victim have not shown flu-like symptoms and are being closely monitored. "This virus is not as serious as H5N1 and H7N9 and the virus is diluted in the air. As long as you don't touch birds - especially those that are dead - and their feces you need not worry too much."
