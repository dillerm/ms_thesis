Avian Influenza in Humans in China (H7N9)
The Centre for Health Protection in China has learned of two additional cases of the low pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza. One was a 44-year-old woman in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region who died last month. The other is a seven-year-old girl in Beijing. This brings the total to 440 cases confirmed on the Mainland. The breakdown of cases by province is as follows: including Zhejiang (139 cases), Guangdong (109 cases), Jiangsu (56 cases), Shanghai (41 cases), Hunan (24 cases), Fujian (22 cases), Anhui (17 cases), Jiangxi (eight cases), Shandong (five cases), Beijing (five cases), Henan (four cases), Guangxi (three cases), Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (three cases), Jilin (two cases), Guizhou (one case) and Hebei (one case). Clinical presentation of avian influenza in humans includes eye infection (conjunctivitis), flu-like symptoms (e.g. fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) or severe respiratory illness (e.g. chest infection). The more virulent forms [e.g. infection by avian influenza A (H5N1, H7N9 or H10N8) viruses] can result in respiratory failure, multi-organ failure and even death. Control measures have been taken at all boundary points, such as thermal imaging systems to check body temperature.
