H5N1 in Poultry in Ukraine
USAID and other groups carried out a public awareness campaign in the Ukraine, a poultry producing region at a crossroads of migratory bird routes, to motivate farmers to use safe handling practices for poultry and prevent the spread of bird flu. A company called Fauna produced a short film and TV series in 2009 to raise awareness of bird flu in Dzhankoy district, an area at high risk for outbreaks. The film showed how people dealt with the outbreak in 2006 by building wire coops to protect poultry from contact with wild birds and separate them from other domestic animals. Local expert, Mykola Arsievych, director of the Naturalist and Environmental Protection Center, also described how they protected the birds in the park by following biosafety rules and practices. The film was shown on a local channel that reaches 30,000 people and was shown to 15,000 school children. Fauna worked with veterinary and emergency services specialists and USAID partner International Relief & Development to produce the film. Lyudmila Yatsishina, the head of the Dzhankoy district veterinary department, said the film was “very timely indeed, as avian influenza is a real threat and it exists all the time.”
