Vietnam
The Vietnamese government has halted the nationwide vaccination of poultry against bird flu because a new strain of H5N1 bird flu may have rendered the vaccine imported from China ineffective. According to the Animal Health Department, the new strain has arisen since 2010 and has been circulating in northern provinces, coastal provinces in the central region, and in the Central Highlands, while the old type of the virus remains active in southern provinces.
