After the outbreak of H5N1 bird flu in turkeys that was diagnosed on March 8, cats were seen eating the carcasses of dead birds before they were removed and the remaining birds were culled. On March 14, 4 cats were found dead and 4 others showed clinical signs of bird flu such as respiratory trouble and weakness. The next day authorities caught 16 cats in the area and euthanized them. Around 50 cats live in the village where the outbreak occurred. Bird flu was confirmed as the cause of illness through laboratory tests conducted by the Kimron Veterinary Institute. Precautions such as movement control, screening, zoning, and disinfection of the premises have been undertaken.
