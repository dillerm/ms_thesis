H5N1 in Poultry in Canada
A second farm has tested positive for H5 avian influenza. The farm, which houses 12,000 chickens, is located within the 3 km quarantine zone set up after the initial outbreak in a turkey farm in January. While it is not known if the virus is the same as the H5N2 as the first outbreak, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA) said that the new virus is also a low pathogenic virus. Because there did not appear to be any connection between the two farms, Sandra Stevens, a CFIA disease control expert said, "... it is quite likely this is an independent introduction of a virus into the barn." A new 3 km quarantine zone will be placed around the second farm, bringing an additional 10 premises under quarantine.
