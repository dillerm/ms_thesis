South Korea (HPAI H5N8)
The Ministry of Agriculture, Food,  and Rural Affairs has reported a total of 14 cases of the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus on poultry farms in the South Jeolla Province.  Since mid-September 196,122 birds have been culled to prevent the spread of the virus.  In addition to culling, facilities will be tested and decontaminated; beginning in December farms with previous outbreaks will be compensated less for future losses and poultry companies will be obligated to train suppliers in disease prevention.  It is believed the virus is being spread by poultry workers moving between farms.
