H5N1 in Humans in Egypt
A 20-year-old woman from Qalyubia governorate hospitalized in critical condition in Cairo has been confirmed to have H5N1 bird flu. According to Health Ministry spokesman Abdel Rahman Shahin, the woman was admitted to the hospital on July 21 with fever and difficulty breathing. She is undergoing treatment with oseltamivir and is being monitored carefully. Reports have not said whether the patient had contact with sick or infected birds. If the World Health Organization (WHO) confirms the woman's infection, she will be listed as Egypt's 110th H5N1 case-patient. Earlier this month, the Egyptian government banned the sale of live poultry in an effort to prevent the spread of H5N1. The pace of detections of the virus has slowed since May, with only 11 reports since the beginning of June. In about half of the outbreaks, the virus was detected during surveillance activities; one occurred at a poultry farm, and the rest involved household birds.
