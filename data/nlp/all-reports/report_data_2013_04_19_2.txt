H5N1 in Poultry in UK
 Officials from the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) confirmed this week that a strain of bird flu was identified at a Bernard Matthews poultry farm in Suffolk, England.  To help prevent the spread of further outbreaks, Bernard Matthews, a company best known for farming turkeys and producing turkey products, is closely monitoring and restricting movements in and out of the farm.  Initial test results show that the strain is not H5 or H7, leading health officials to believe that the “strain is a low-risk to public health.”  Experts said that the most plausible cause of the outbreak was through infected meat being imported from Hungary.  The infected birds from the farm are being treated with antibiotics and the farm will most likely be up and running as normal within the next couple of days.
