H5N1 in Wild birds
A new study headed by Yoshihiro Kawaoka at UW-Madison suggests that it would be possible for H5N1 bird flu and seasonal flu or H1N1 to recombine and form a new strain of flu that would be highly contagious and deadly. Bird flu currently does not transmit easily to humans, but has a high death rate (59%). The new research published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science suggests that, in a person co-infected with bird flu and pandemic H1N1 (2009), the viruses could exchange genetic information and produce a new strain. Previous lab studies had suggested that hybrid viruses were less dangerous than their parent strains, but experiments on mice indicate that it is possible for H3N2 and H5N1 influenza viruses to combine into a deadly strain.
