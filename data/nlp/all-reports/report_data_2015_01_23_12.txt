Egypt (HPAI H5N1)
According to the Director of the Preventive Medicine Department, a total of 13 people suspected of being infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus have been quarantined in the Nile Delta city of Menofiya.   Samples from the patients will be sent to the central labs for analysis.  Recently, a 43 year-old woman died in the southern city of Asyut five days after being hospitalized.  A six-year-old child in the Minya province and a 47-year-old woman in the Assiut province also died of the disease.  This brings the total number of cases in Egypt to 20 so far this year, including five deaths, six recoveries, and nine cases still under treatment.  The World Health Organization says there has been a rise in the number of H5N1 human infections in Egypt, but there does not appear to have been a major genetic change in the strain.  Most of the cases have been in poor rural areas in the south, where villagers often raise and slaughter poultry themselves.
