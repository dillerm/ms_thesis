H5N1 in Poultry in South Korea
Low pathogenic H5N2 bird flu has broken out on a duck farm in Chung Chong-Namdo province. Forty of 26,800 ducks tested positive for the disease, but the source of the infection is unknown. The Livestock Health Control Association collected samples from the farm as part of a routine surveillance program and the Chungchong-Namdo Veterinary Research Institute tested them on December 7. The National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service confirmed the results on December 22. All of the ducks on the farm were culled and the 176,000 eggs kept on the farm were destroyed to prevent the spread of the virus. The carcasses of the ducks were burned and buried. An investigation of epidemiologically related farms is currently underway.
