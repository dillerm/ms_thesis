United Kingdom.
In order to reduce the spread of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus among children, the United Kingdom government has issued guidelines requiring nurseries to remove communal recreational items from their facilities. This includes teddy bears and other soft toys, crayon and coloring pencils, among other things. The guidance, which was issued by the Department for Children, Schools and Families, said that these types of toys could not be cleaned adequately, so it was better to remove them. In addition, nurseries have been required to suspend morning assemblies or any other kind of event that would bring large groups of children together in an enclosed space. The DCSF has also issued guidelines for dealing with a child that develops symptoms of swine flu during the day. The child should be isolated immediately from the other children, and a member of the staff should remain in charge of the childâ€™s care. The staff member should wear a mask at all times, and should remain one meter away from the child unless the child needs help. Both guidelines are part of an effort to prepare for the likely second wave of the pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus this fall, in which millions could potentially fall ill.
