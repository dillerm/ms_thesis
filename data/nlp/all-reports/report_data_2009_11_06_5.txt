HIN1 in Pigs and Other Animals in Iceland
An outbreak of pandemic H1N1 (2009) in pigs began October 24 on a farm in the Gullbringu district. Ten of 4,500 pigs on the farm presented symptoms such as loss of appetite, fever, coughing, and miscarriage. The pigs are suspected to have been infected from sick farm workers, two of whom had experienced flu-like symptoms a few days prior to the outbreak in the pigs. Tests run by the Institute for Experimental Pathology at Keldur, Iceland, confirmed pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus.
