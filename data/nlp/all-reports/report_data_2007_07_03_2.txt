H5N1 in Wild Birds in Czech Republic

The reservoir is said to be one of the  “most risky areas” through which many wild birds move, “but from the veterinary  point of view it is a rather good locality as there are no big bird farms  around,” Salava said. The location is over 140 km from the H5N1 outbreaks in  poultry in Tisova and Norin in East Bohemia. (more...)
