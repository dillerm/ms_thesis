It was announced on November 18 that a cat from Lebanon, Oregon died from pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus. This is believed to be the first case of a feline dying from the disease in the United States. The cat most likely contracted the disease from a human; a household member had been sick with flu-like symptoms a week prior to the cat developing clinical signs. The 10-year-old male cat was brought to the clinic on Nov. 4 because of labored breathing but died 3 days later. The Oregon State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory confirmed that the cat tested positive for H1N1. Veterinarians advise sick pet owners and owners of sick pets to wash their hands thoroughly and frequently. Another cat from Park City, Utah tested positive for pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus after contact with its sick owner. The cat was taken to the veterinarian on November 3 for labored breathing. H1N1 infection was confirmed on November 13 by the laboratory at Iowa State University.
