H5N1 in Poultry in India
 On September 14 in the Indian state of West Bengal, 849 birds found dead in a village were reported to the local Animal Resources Development (ARD).  After the birds tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, an estimated 51,000 hens and ducks will be culled within a 3 kilometer radius of the infected zone to prevent the spread of the virus.  As the culling area of 3 kilometers includes portions of Bangladesh, the ARD will be in communication with Bangladesh officials.  To further stem the spread of disease, closure of poultry markets and prohibition on sale and transportation of poultry products within 10 kilometers of the infected zone as well as disinfection of the affected area are part of the surveillance campaign.  Other control measures include quarantine and screening.  The source of the outbreak remains unknown.
