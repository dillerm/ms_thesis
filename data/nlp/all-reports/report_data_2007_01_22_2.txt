H5N1 in Wild Birds in Thailand:
This week, conflicting   reports surfaced of H5N1 detection in wild birds in the central province of   Suphan Buri, Thailand. Speaking about the discovery of H5N1 in domestic ducks in   Phitsanulok province (see below), Dr. Thawat Suntrajarn, the Director General of   the Disease Control Department, said that random checks in December 2006 also   found the same virus in birds in Suphan Buri: "Four pigeons were among a group   of wild birds that died last month in the central province of Suphan Buri.    Tests confirmed they had the H5N1 strain of avian influenza."  However, the   deputy permanent secretary for the Agriculture and Cooperatives Ministry   dismisses the report that a wild bird found in Suphan Buri was positive for   H5N1.
