H5N1 in Poultry in Germany.
The Freidrich Loeffler Institute reported that H5N1 has been  detected in a pet (domestic) goose on a small farm located in Wickersdorf in  Thuringia. The farm kept four other geese and five ducks, none of which tested  positive for H5N1, but all were killed as a precaution. The goose, which was  purchased from a farm in Schorba near Jena, was allowed to roam freely and  contact with wild birds is suspected as the route of infection. Although the  farm is said to be in a “remote area,” over 1,000 domestic fowl have been  culled within the 3 km quarantine zone. This marks the second time in which  H5N1 was found in domestic poultry. In 2006, a goose farm near Leipzig was  affected. (more...)
