Ireland (HPAI H5N8)
A new case of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N8) was discovered in a wild duck in the town of Wexford in Ireland. The bird was found alive but unable to fly. Control measures include mandatory housing of poultry. The public was advised to report multiple wild bird deaths in the same location. Further testing will determine whether the virus found in Ireland is the same strain that has been found in Great Britain and Europe.
