Denmark (LPAI H5N2)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports cases of low pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus at a mallard duck farm in the province of West Jutland.  This was confirmed by the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration (Fødevarestyrelsen), after samples were tested by the National Veterinary Institute.  Samples were taken as part of a national surveillance program, and all 1,200 ducklings on the farm will be culled to prevent the disease spreading.  Additional control measures include movement control, quarantine, zoning, disinfection and disinfestation, stamping out, and official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste.  The source of this outbreak is unknown.
