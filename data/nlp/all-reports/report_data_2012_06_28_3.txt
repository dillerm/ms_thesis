South Africa (LPAI).
Two commercial ostrich farms, one in Western Cape Province and one in Eastern Cape Province are experiencing outbreaks of low pathogenic H7N1. Tests at the Agricultural Research Councilâ€™s Onderstepoort Veterinary Institute on June 1 confirmed the presence of the virus. A total of 1,833 ostriches were housed on the two farms; 44 became ill and 1,493 (all of the ostriches on the Eastern Cape Province Farm) were slaughtered. The infection was discovered during routine surveillance. The source of the outbreak is unknown but control measures such as quarantine, movement control, screening, and disinfection of the premises have been undertaken.
