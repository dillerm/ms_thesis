Taiwan (HPAI H5N2)
The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported two additional cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in turkeys at farm in Yunlin County and in geese at slaughterhouse in Taoyuan County.  A total of 681 birds died and 1,919 were culled out of 2,600 birds to prevent further spread of the virus.  Avian influenza was confirmed by testing birds with abnormal deaths and carcasses that showed signs of the virus.  The farm where the birds originated is being tested as well.  To prevent further spread of the disease the practices of movement control, screening, disinfection, quarantine, stamping out and zoning were implemented. The source of the outbreak is unknown. The Bureau of Animal Health Inspection of Quarantine has reported that 3,500 ducks in Pingtung County have been culled after testing positive for the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus.  The birds were tested following detection of the virus on a nearby farm. The Bureau also reported another case of H5N2 in chickens at a slaughterhouse in Taitung County.  The chickens were culled to prevent further spread of the virus, as were the birds at the three farms in Pingtung County where they originated.
