H5N1 in Poultry in Laos
More than 7000 poultry in Luang Prabang province will be destroyed following a die-off of ducks at a private farm on August 27th. The mortality event was closely followed by another 350 bird deaths in a nearby village.  Testing for H5N1 started on September 4th and positive results were announced 5 days later.  Laos, which recently established more stringent precautions involving bird flu, has been free of the virus since March.
