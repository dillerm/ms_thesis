H5N1 in Wild Birds in Vietnam
A four-year-old boy from Son La province that died from H5N1 on December 16 (see below for details) may have been infected from wild birds. All poultry around the boy's home have tested negative. But according to Van Dang Ky, an official with the Department of Animal Health, the boy might have been exposed to the virus from wild birds that family members brought home after hunting.
