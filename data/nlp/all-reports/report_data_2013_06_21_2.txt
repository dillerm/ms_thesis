Avian Influenza in Poultry in USA
The Arkansas Livestock and Poultry Commission confirmed that chickens have tested positive for low pathogenic H7N7 earlier this week. In response to the outbreak, officials have placed a quarantine on poultry within a 6.2 mile radius of the infected farm. While the source of the outbreak remains unknown, officials believe that recent flooding may have contaminated the water, putting poultry at risk for contracting the bird flu virus.
