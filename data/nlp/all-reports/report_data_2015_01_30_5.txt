Avian Influenza in Humans in Canada ex China (LPAI H7N9)
Health officials have confirmed the first documented human case of the low pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza in Canada.  The woman, a resident of British Columbia, had recently returned from China and was not showing symptoms while traveling.  The individual did not require hospitalization and is currently recovering in self-isolation.  Close contacts of the individual have been notified and their health is being monitored by local health authorities.  The risk of infection from H7N9 is low as it does not transmit easily from person-to-person. On Jan 30, the husband, who traveled with the index case to China, was also confirmed to be positive for H7N9.
