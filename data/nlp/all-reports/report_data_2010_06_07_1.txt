H5N1 in Wild birds
Teams of scientists working for the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) have found that efforts to monitor bird flu in Southeast Asia have the added benefit of providing information on rare bird species. Recently a team working in Indonesia recorded new information about the distribution of the Nordmann's greenshank, an endangered shorebird species with a total global population of only 500-1,000. Their findings were published in BirdingASIA. "While our surveillance activities are mostly focused on testing birds for avian influenza as part of WCS's ongoing health investigations, we can also fill gaps in our understanding of the migration range of many bird species," said Joost Philippa, WCS field veterinarian and co-author on the paper. "Our research findings have applications for both health and conservation efforts alike." Monitoring has also provided valuable information about the presence of bird flu in Indonesiaâ€™s shore birds. About 15% of the 578 birds tested so far have been positive for low-pathogenic strains of avian influenza. These are the first findings to show that shore birds are a reservoir of bird flu viruses.
