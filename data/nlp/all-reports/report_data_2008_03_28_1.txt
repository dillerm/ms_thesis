H5N1 in Wild birds in Switzerland
A duck that showed no signs of illness has tested positive for H5N1 in Sempachersee (Lake Sempach), near Lucern, Switzerland. The wild duck was one of 200 birds being tested as part of a routine surveillance program. According to the Federal Veterinary Office, the virus appears to be similar to the strains detected in Europe last year. This is the first H5N1 case in Switzerland since 2006.
