France (LPAI H5N9)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports two new outbreaks of low-pathogenic H5N9 avian influenza.  The outbreaks occurred on December 8 and 12 at commercial duck farms in the Gers Department of southern France.  The disease was detected because the ducks were required to be tested upon leaving an established protected area; none of the animals showed clinical signs.
