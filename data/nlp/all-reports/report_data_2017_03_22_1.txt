Austria (HPAI H5N8)
Highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza was detected in 21 Dalmatian pelicans at the Schoenbrunn Zoo in Vienna.  The zoo’s pelicans have been kept in a tent since December to prevent infection, but on March 6, one pelican became ill. It was euthanized the same day because of the severity of the disease, and subsequent tests confirmed that it had been infected with HPAI H5N8.  The entire flock was then tested, and all 20 remaining birds were positive for the virus; on March 10, they were also euthanized. Until this happened, the Schoenbrunn Zoo had the world’s largest flock of the endangered Dalmatian pelicans.
