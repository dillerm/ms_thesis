H5N1 in Poultry in South Africa (LPAI).
Additional ostriches on seven farms in the Klein Karoo valley will be culled after birds in the area tested positive for low pathogenic bird flu. Their skin and feathers will be harvested and the meat will be used in pet food. Bird flu was detected in the province last month and exports of ostrich meat to the European Union were immediately suspended. At least 10,000 birds have already been culled; sampling continues on farms so the Western Cape agriculture department cannot yet estimate the total number to be culled. . The economy of the Klein Karoo valley, based on ostrich production, has been seriously impacted by this outbreak. A team of experts from the European Union has travelled to the area to assist in implementing control measures.
