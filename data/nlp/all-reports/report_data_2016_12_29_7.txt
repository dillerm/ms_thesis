Highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza has been detected in poultry in Japan and South Korea.  On December 16, 30 chickens were found dead at a farm in Shizuoka Prefecture, central Japan.  Testing confirmed the presence of HPAI H5N6, and the remaining 210,000 chickens were culled the next day.  In South Korea, H5N6 has been detected in the province of South Jeolla for the first time; two outbreaks on commercial duck farms were reported on December 17.  Adjacent North Jeolla Province has had 14 outbreaks of H5N6 to date, and the disease appears to be spreading rapidly.
