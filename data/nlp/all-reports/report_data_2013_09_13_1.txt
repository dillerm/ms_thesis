Avian Influenza in Poultry in Nepal (H5N1)
The poultry industry in Nepal is reporting the closure of thousands of businesses and losses of over 7 billion rupees ($70 million USD) in the poultry sector, due to a recent outbreak of H5N1 in Kathmandu valley and other areas in Nepal. Consumer anxiety over rumors of the bird flu, rather than actual death of poultry, has caused the greatest blow to the poultry market in these areas. Businesspersons are predicting that with the poultry sector contributing nearly 4 percent of Nepal’s GDP, these losses will create a significant deficit in the country’s economy.
