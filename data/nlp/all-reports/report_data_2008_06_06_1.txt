H5N1 in Wild birds in China
A study by Li et al. (2008)Â reported on the pathogenicity of two H5N1 viruses isolated from wild ducks (no species provided) in December 2005 near Dongting Lake, in Hunan province. One H5N1 isolate was highly pathogenic in chickens and geese, but not in ducks and mice. Another H5N1 isolate was highly pathogenic in chickens, geese, ducks and mice. Both isolates could be transmitted from duck to duck and replicated in the lungs and brains of mice.
