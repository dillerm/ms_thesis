Ghana (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported an additional case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in a village in the Central Region.Â  A total of 34 chickens, ducks and turkeys died and 476 were culled out of 510 birds to prevent further spread of the virus. In addition to culling, the practices of stamping out, quarantine, movement control, and disinfection were carried out. The source of the outbreak is unknown, but Ghana had previously reported H5N1 outbreaks in the Western region in mid-October.
