H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
In Central Java, 300 broilers from a commercial farm and 50 backyard chickens died of H5N1 bird flu. “We received reports of bird flu suspicion, and then confirmed it by rapid test to the dead chickens,” said Slamet Saryono, the head of the Livestock and Fishery Service. The backyard chickens were observed dying first and after several days the chickens on the commercial farm began to die as well. The bodies of the dead chickens have been burnt to prevent the spread of the disease, and around 7,200 chickens from local houses and commercial farms will be quarantined for 14 days.In Surabaya, East Java, 76 chickens owned by a resident died suddenly.  Because the owner had disposed of the bodies, the Livestock Service of Surabaya diagnosed bird flu through rapid tests of throat mucus and shedding of the virus in the surviving chickens. Instead of stamping out the surviving chickens and burning their cages, all birds in the area will be confined to cages and monitored for two weeks.
