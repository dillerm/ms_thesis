Hong Kong (HPAI H5N6)
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) in Hong Kong has confirmed that a Oriental magpie-robin found dead last week was infected with the  highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus. The test was a confirmation of preliminary H5-positive test results.  The bird, a common species resident to the area, was found dead in a staircase of an apartment building in the New Territories region where there are no poultry farms nearby. To prevent further spread of the disease, a range of precautionary measures were implemented, including increased inspections of poultry farms and markets, educating bird shop owners and racing pigeon enthusiasts, and stopping the illegal importation of birds. The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported an additional case of highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus in an oriental magpie-robin in Hong Kong. The bird was detected via an ongoing wild bird surveillance system, and the source of the outbreak is unknown. Laboratory tests are being conducted by the Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory and the Centre of Influenza Research at the University of Hong Kong. To monitor any potential spread of the disease, the OIE has implemented an intensive surveillance program for all pet bird shops, poultry markets and poultry farms in Hong Kong.
