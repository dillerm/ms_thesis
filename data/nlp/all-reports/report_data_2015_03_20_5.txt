Netherlands (LPAI H7N7)
A free-range farm near the town of Barneveld has tested positive for low pathogenic avian influenza virus H7N7.  To prevent the disease from spreading, 27,000 chickens at the farm have been destroyed.  The government has also imposed a ban on poultry transport for farms within a 1 km radius.
