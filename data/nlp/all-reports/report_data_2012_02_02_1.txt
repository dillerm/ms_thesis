H5N1 in Wild birds in Pakistan
A report filed on January 10, confirmed the death of 15 peacocks over the previous week at Safari Park (also known as Woodland Wildlife Park) in the province of Punjab was due to the H5N1 bird flu virus. Park Director Yousuf Paul said the disease is believed to have come from the hens and chickens of some nearby poultry farms. In regards to other birds caged with the dead peacocks, Jinnah Hospital Chief Executive and Principal of the Allama Iqbal Medical College Dr. Javed Akram advised administrators to kill those infected and dispose of them away from the zoo area. He also suggested protective masks for workers. The virus was previously found in domestic poultry in the province when 18 birds died and the remainder destroyed. A Food, Agriculture and Livestock Ministry spokesman said the virus had also been detected in a flock of peacocks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa.
