Romania (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports that highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 has been detected for the first time in Romania.  On November 23, a great cormorant was found dead in Constanta harbor, on the Black Sea in southeastern Romania.  This is the same day that a mute swan was found dead 300 m away; the swan also tested positive for H5N8, but the OIE is treating these two occurrences as separate outbreaks.  Control measures are in place, and include movement control inside the country, zoning, screening, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, and control of wildlife reservoirs. This same region has had a history of HPAI H5N1 infection.
