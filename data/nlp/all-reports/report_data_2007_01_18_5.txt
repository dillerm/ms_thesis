H5N1 in Humans
The Korean Center of Disease Control and Prevention announced this week that a poultry worker was infected with H5N1 in the recent outbreaks in that country.  The person was not indentified and no details are available at this time, but the individual is said not to have developed any serious symptoms.  The individual was one of 26 residents living near the four affected farms who have been tested so far for antibodies to H5N1.  The testing of another 59 individuals, including farm owners and poultry workers, is not yet completed.
