H5N1 in Wild birds in South Korea
According to a statement from the South Korean government on February 7, migratory wild birds are primarily responsible for the most severe outbreak of bird flu to hit South Korea. Seoul confirmed its first outbreaks of the virulent H5N1 strain on Dec 31 after some poultry farms reported sudden deaths of animals earlier in the month. Since then, more than 5.41 million birds have been culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Joo Yi-seok, head of the animal disease control bureau at the National Veterinary Research and Quarantine Service, said, "Direct contact with infected wild birds and indirect contamination caused by people and vehicles stepping on bird droppings may have triggered 22 of the 40 confirmed cases, with the rest involving the virus being spread inadvertently by contaminated bird feed and rice husks used in coops." The strains of bird flu detected in South Korea were nearly identical to those in migratory birds from Mongolia and China. He added that since the birds remain in the country until spring, there might be outbreaks of bird flu through April and urged people to prevent wild birds and rodents from coming into contact with their poultry.
