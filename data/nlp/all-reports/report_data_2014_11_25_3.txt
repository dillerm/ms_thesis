UK (HPAI H5N8)
According to the U.K. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the highly pathogenic H5N8 was discovered at Nafferton Farm in East Yorkshire.  6,000 Pekin ducks were culled and a two mile restriction zone as well as a six mile surveillance zone has been set up around the farm.  The two most likely causes of the infection are either through wild migratory birds spreading the virus, or through droppings from infected birds being transferred by vehicle movements. This marks the bird flu case in the U.K. since 2008.  The risk of human infection is low, as the H5N8 strand has never been found in humans.
