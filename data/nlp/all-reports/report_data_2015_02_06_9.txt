USA (HPAI H5N8)
Nevada agricultural officials reported a case of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza in a hunter-harvest mallard duck in Lincoln County.  The Nevada Department of Agriculture will work with the United States Department of Agriculture's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to monitor the situation, but so far it is an isolated case. An additional case of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza was reported in a 4-H flock of chickens and waterfowl in Oroville, Washington.  A much larger flock in Riverside, Washington, has also been infected.  The 5,000 birds of mostly game birds at the Riverside farm will be culled before the smaller Oroville flock.  A quarantine has been set around both infected farms, and government officials have sampled 21 nearby flocks to see if the virus has spread.
