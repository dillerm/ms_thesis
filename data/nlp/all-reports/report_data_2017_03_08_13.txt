USA (HPAI H7N9)
The U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service reported that highly pathogenic avian influenza (H7N9) at a broiler breeder farm in southern Tennessee. The farm has been placed under quarantine and the flock of 73,500 birds will be culled. Approximately 30 additional farms in a 10km radius of the farm have been placed under quarantine. Producers in the area have imposed heightened biosecurity measures. Genetic characterization of the virus showed that it is entirely of North American wild bird origin and not related to the H7N9 strain in China.
