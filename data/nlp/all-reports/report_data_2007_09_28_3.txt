H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
Avian influenza has been detected on a farm in northern Bangladesh. The farmer submitted several chickens that had died on his farm for testing and avian influenza was detected. The subtype of avian influenza virus was not available. Around 6,000 chickens will be culled in the village. Since the discovery of bird flu at Savar, near the capital Dhaka in March, the virus has been detected in 18 of the countryâ€™s 64 districts.
