Israel (HPAI H5N8)
Outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 were discovered by the Agriculture and Rural Development Ministry at poultry farms in Be’er Tuvia, En Zurim, and Kibbutz Revadim. All three outbreaks are in Ashkelon district in northern Israel. Two farms raised turkeys and the third raised “heavy” breeders. The Ministry is working to eradicate the virus from each site. Officials are monitoring the area. Samples from chicken coops in a 10km radius of the farms have been collected for testing and officials encourage breeders in the region to keep flocks inside.
