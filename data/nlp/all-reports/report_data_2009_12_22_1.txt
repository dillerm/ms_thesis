Netherlands.
A new disease that people are calling “goat flu,” but is more accurately called Q fever is attacking goats, sheep, and people in the Netherlands. The disease is caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii, not an influenza virus, but the symptoms are similar to influenza. This disease has infected around 2,300 people in the Netherlands and 6 have died, all of whom had other health problems. The government is planning to cull around 15,000 to 20,000 goats and sheep to prevent the spread of the disease.
