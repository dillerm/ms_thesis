H5N1 in Humans in China
A 19 year-old woman died from H5N1 avian influenza in the city of Beijing earlier this month. She had developed symptoms in late December and was hospitalized, but died from complications on January 5th, 2009. The woman had purchased nine ducks at a local market and then shared them with her family, so officials are monitoring her friends and family and 102 health care workers who had contact with the patient, though it appears that she was the only affected individual. The ducks themselves have been traced to Tianjin City, just outside Beijing. Paul Chan, a microbiologist at the Chinese University in Hong Kong said he was worried that the human case was not associated with detection of infection in the poultry, saying "The source of this infection seems to be the poultry or the market [where the girl bought the ducks]. If that is true, we need to know why we missed the outbreak of the virus in poultry or in the market," Chan said. The last human fatality in China occurred in February of last year.
