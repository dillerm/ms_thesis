H5N1 in Wild birds in Germany
The first case in 2009 of a lethal strain of bird flu was reported in the EU. A duck shot near the town of Starnberg in January tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The duck was part of a flock of 35 ducks and 4 Canada geese that were shot on Jan. 11. The last outbreak of H5N1 in Germany was in a farm in Saxony last October.
