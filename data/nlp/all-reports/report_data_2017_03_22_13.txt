Vietnam (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports two new outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Vietnam.  Both outbreaks occurred on 3 March; one involved a backyard poultry flock in Bắc Ninh Province, in the northern part of the country, and the other involved a backyard poultry flock in Tây Ninh Province in southern Vietnam.  Between the two, 2,050 birds died from the disease and 4,550 were destroyed.  Other control measures include vaccination in response to the outbreak, disinfection/disinfestation, stamping out, and surveillance within containment and/or protection zone.
