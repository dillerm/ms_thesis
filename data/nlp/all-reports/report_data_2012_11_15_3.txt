H5N1 in Poultry in Australia
 An unidentified strain of bird flu was detected in a free-range layer farm in New South Wales, causing a quarantine of the roughly 50,000 chickens. Five thousand hens have died and samples from the hens have determined the virus is not the H5N1 strain but rather highly pathogenic avian influenza with the H7 subtype. According to reports, the facility contains several dams that attract wild birds. Tracing and surveillance are in place to ensure the virus has not spread to other farms. The New South Wales Food Authority assured the public that the virus does not pose a risk to humans, and that the virus is killed by cooking at temperatures above 70 degrees C. Currently, only the H5N1strain can transmit from birds to humans.  Scientists in Australia are experimenting with “gene silencing” in an effort to immunize chickens against the bird flu virus.
