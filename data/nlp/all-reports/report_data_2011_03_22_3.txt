H5N1 in wild birds in Taiwan
Researchers at the National Sun Yat-sen University urged farmers in central and southern Taiwan to reinforce the nets around their chicken ranches to prevent the invasion of cattle egrets, which they suggest could be major carriers and spreaders of the H5N1 bird flu virus.  According to Chang Hsueh-wen, a Biology professor at the University, long-term observations and studies by his team found that cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis) were frequently lured to chicken ranches to catch insects that were attracted by chicken droppings.  Chang added that the cattle egrets tend to mix with other migratory birds at wetlands or water reservoirs in southern parts of the island, and that this allows the egrets to easily spread H5N1 bird flu viruses that can also infect human beings.
