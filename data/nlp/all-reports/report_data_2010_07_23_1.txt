H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
Thousands of chickens have died in the past three weeks in three villages in Bengkulu province. Inspection by animal infectious disease control personnel on June 20 confirmed H5N1 as the cause of death. Poultry in the area were immediately quarantined in another location to prevent infection. Officials have asked communities to watch for symptoms of bird flu, to burn or bury any birds that are ill, and to report any incidents immediately to the local government.
