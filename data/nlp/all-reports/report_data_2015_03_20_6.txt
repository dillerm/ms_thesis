USA (HPAI H5N2)
According to the United States Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), an outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus has been confirmed in a backyard chicken and duck flock in Leavenworth County.  This marks the first finding of highly pathogenic avian influenza in the Central Flyway, but the location is immediately adjacent to the Mississippi Flyway. To prevent further spread of the virus, the premises were quarantined and the birds have been culled. Additional surveillance and testing are also underway in the area.
