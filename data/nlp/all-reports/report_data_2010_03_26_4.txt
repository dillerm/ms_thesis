A 59-year-old man from Lampung province died of suspected bird flu on March 18. The man had been sick for a month and bird flu is suspected because many chickens had recently died near his house. He was brought to Immanuel hospital for a check-up and bronchopneumonia was discovered, possibly caused by bird flu and chronic hepatitis B infection. He was transferred to Abdoel Moeloek regional hospital, but died soon after his arrival.
