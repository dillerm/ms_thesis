H5N1 in Poultry in Iran
 A source in the Hashtgerd area recently reported that H5N1bird flu has been found in four cities (Abyek, Karaj, Qazvin, and Urmiyeh) in Iran. The government has killed a large number of poultry birds, including broiler, layer and breeding hens during the past 50 days. This has led to an increase in the price of broiler hens and their eggs in the country.
