Taiwan (H5N2 is now HPAI)
On February 2, an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N2 bird flu began on a farm in Tâ€™ai-Nan municipality. There were 4,840 broiler breeder chickens on the farm and 804 died from the disease. The remaining 4,306 birds were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Clinical and epidemiological investigations have been implemented but the origin of the outbreak remains unknown. The mortality rate was about 16.6% and tests run by the Animal Health Research Institute confirmed that the birds were infected with a highly pathogenic strain of H5N2 bird flu. Control measures are underway including, quarantine, movement control, screening, zoning, and disinfection of the premises. A farm in Changhua County is suspected of having an outbreak of bird flu after more than 120 hens died on March 5. Inspectors collected tissue samples to see if the birds were infected with the highly pathogenic H5N2 strain that was first detected on another farm in Changhua County in December of 2011. Officials are controlling the movement of all live fowl and fresh eggs from infected farms. The Health Bureau of Taichung has decided to vaccinate poultry against H5N1 bird flu. In Taipei, officials have ordered quarantine measures at poultry markets to prevent the H5N2 virus from spreading. They are also conducting checks on pet stores, breeding farms, and parks; so far, 4,000 samples have been tested and none showed signs of bird flu. Controversy has erupted over whether the H5N2 outbreak detected earlier in the year had indications of high pathogenicity, but the results were not reported to the OIE because of political pressure. A number of investigations and reviews have been launched to investigate this matter.
