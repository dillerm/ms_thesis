H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
Avian influenza is estimated to have killed over half a million chickens in Jakarta over the last six months and not all outbreaks were reported to the health authorities, according to the Jakarta Post. The estimate was from a survey of 10 farmers with between 100-200 chickens each in Jakarta, Tangrang, Bogor and Bekasi. "Chickens die everywhere. The problem is the deaths are not always reported," Heru Setjanto, Bogot Institute of Agriculture said. Part of the problem is the lack of field officers who can receive the outbreak reports. Indonesia has only 200 animal health posts across the country and in nearly half of the posts are not functioning due to the lack of veterinarians.
