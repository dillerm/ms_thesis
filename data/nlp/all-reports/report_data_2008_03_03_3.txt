H5N1 in Poultry in China
An outbreak of H5N1 in poultry has been reported in the mountainous southwestern province of Guizhou, the Ministry of Agriculture announced on Feb. 25the same day that a woman died from bird flu elsewhere in the south. Nearly 4,000 birds have died in the outbreak that began on Feb.17 and 238,000 birds will be culled. It is Chinaâ€™s fourth H5N1 outbreak in poultry this year. Two of the outbreaks have been in Tibet, and a third in Xinjiang.A statistical analysis of H5N1 genetic diversity shows that many strains of bird flu have been prevented from entering Thailand and Vietnam from China. Only a subset of the genetic diversity of H5N1 in China has invaded these countries, adding support to the idea that poultry trade is the main mechanism of bird flu spread and that geopolitical action may limit its spread.
