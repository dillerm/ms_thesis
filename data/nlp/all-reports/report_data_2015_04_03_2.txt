USA (HPAI H5N2)
The Montana Department of Livestock reported on March 31 the first documented case of HPAI H5N2 bird flu in Montana, found in a dead captive gyrfalcon from Columbia Falls in Flathead County.  The gyrfalcon may have been exposed to the virus by consuming parts of a duck hunted in December.  The falconer has about 50 other captive birds, which will all be tested for avian influenza.  The Department of Livestock will monitor the flocks of poultry producers in the area.
