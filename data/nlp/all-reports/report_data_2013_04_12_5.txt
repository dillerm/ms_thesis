H7N9 in Humans in China
 As the number of H7N9 cases keep rising (to date, 43 cases have been confirmed and eleven people have died), authorities in the city of Shanghai and in the city of Hangzhou, the capital of eastern Zhejiang province, have banned the sale of live fowl, including chickens, pigeons, and quail, and have culled all poultry at markets where the virus has been detected.  The virus, which has now been detected in chickens, ducks, pigeons and quail, is troubling scientists because, “in the past usually you would see chickens dying before any infections occurred in humans, but this time we’ve seen that many species of poultry actually have no apparent problems, so that makes it difficult because you lose this natural warning sign.”  Health authorities around the country are on high alert and continue discussing ways to help prevent further spread of this deadly disease.
