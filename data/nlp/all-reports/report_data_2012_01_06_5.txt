H5N1 in Humans in China
 On December 31, a 39-year-old male bus driver died a week after being admitted to a hospital with a fever. The Shenzhen Disease Control Center confirmed that he died from the H5N1 bird flu strain that is intransmissible from human to human. The man was reported to have had no contact with poultry and had not travelled out of his home city of Shenzhen before becoming ill. The Chinese Health Ministry said that he had taken 5 days of leave prior to becoming sick and had gone jogging every morning in an area with many migratory birds. The claim that the man contracted the disease from wild birds was dismissed by Lo Wing-lok, a Hong Kong legislator, “This is a poultry virus, not a wild bird virus. Blaming human infection on wild birds is not conducive to epidemic control because people might become complacent about poultry, about slaughtering sick birds. As a result, more human cases could occur,” Lok said.
