H5N1 in Wild birds in Japan
A third tufted duck (Aythya fuligula) found dead in Fukushima Prefecture has been confirmed positive for H5N1 bird flu, according to a report by the prefectural government on January 20. The Environment Ministry dispatched a fact-finding team to the northeastern prefecture January 21, believing the virus detected in Fukushima is related to the virus discovered in a wild duck in Hokkaido last October.  Three whooper swans, a northern pintail and a duck of Aythya species collected from the wetland in northeastern Hokkaido has tested positive for H5N1.
