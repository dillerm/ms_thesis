Avian Influenza in Humans in Egypt (HPAI H5N1)
Egyptian health officials reported that a 19 year old woman died on Monday of the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu at a hospital in the southeast region of Assiut. The woman raised domestic chickens, which is thought to be the source of the infection. A second death occurred Tuesday, of a 30-year-old woman in the southern province of Minya. This brings the number of confirmed cases in the country this year to seven, three of which died. In Egypt, most cases have been identified in rural areas, where villagers tend to raise poultry in their homes, thus increasing exposure to infected birds. Since 2006, there have been 180 cases of bird flu, 66 of which were fatal. The ministry said it has taken measures to monitor the disease at all hospitals countrywide and to build a stockpile of the Tamiflu medicine. It has also set up isolation units at hospitals and is undertaking training for medical teams.
