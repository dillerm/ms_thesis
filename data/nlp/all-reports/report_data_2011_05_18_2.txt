H5N1 in Poultry in South Korea
 The South Korean government recently announced that starting next year, it will reduce compensation to farmers affected by livestock diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease and avian influenza.  The agriculture ministry says that if outbreaks of diseases were brought on by the farmers' negligence, compensation will be cut by up to 80 percent, and under no circumstances will their damages be fully covered. Also, when farm owners do not report the employment of migrant workers or fail to sterilize the area thoroughly enough to prevent animal diseases, their licenses will be revoked. Large farms with an annual income of 60 million won, or 55,000 US dollars, will be under review starting next year; smaller farms will be required to do the same by 2015.
