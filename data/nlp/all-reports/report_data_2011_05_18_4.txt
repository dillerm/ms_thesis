H7 in Poultry in The Netherlands
Dutch authorities said on May 12 that they would destroy 8,800 chickens at an organic poultry farm in Kootwijkerbroek after the discovery of H7 bird flu infection. Further characterization of the virus subtype and pathogenicity is pending.  In addition, authorities said that 60 farms within a 2-mile radius of the farm would be screened for the virus.  A ban on the transport of poultry, eggs and manure within the 3 kilometer zone has been instituted.
