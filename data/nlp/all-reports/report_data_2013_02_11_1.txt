H5N1 in Wild birds in Thailand
The Thailand Department of National Parks, Wildlife, and Plant Conservation is continuing its nationwide campaign to randomly test birds around the country for the deadly avian influenza virus, H5N1, in hopes to prevent further outbreaks. The team recently collected samples from over 300 barn swallows in Phuket province and will be collecting samples in Samut Prakan province, Trang provice, and Krabi province in the upcoming months. In addition to looking at the birdsâ€™ overall health, they are also testing their saliva and droppings. Since 2004, Thailand has reported 25 cases of human infection, 17 resulting in deaths; however, the country has not had any human deaths in the past six years and officials hope that the randomized tests will help combat further spread.
