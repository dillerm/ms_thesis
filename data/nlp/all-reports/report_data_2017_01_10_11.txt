India (HPAI H5N1)
Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 has been detected in two places in India.  First, On December 26, officials informed the public that H5N1 avian influenza had been found in Keranga Village, Odisha State in eastern India.  The outbreak was detected after an unusual chicken mortality event.  Preventative measures include closing poultry and egg markets in the area, movement restrictions, and a 10-km protection and surveillance zone around the location of the morality event.  In addition, poultry-culling is taking place on nearby farms. The second outbreak occurred on January 3, when officials confirmed that H5N1 was present in samples taken following a mortality event among turkeys at an animal rescue facility in Ahmedabad, Gujarat State, western India.  As a precautionary measure, other birds at the rescue facility and backyard poultry housed near the facility will be culled; movement of animals, droppings, and farm equipment is also restricted.  This is the first outbreak of H5N1 in Gujarat since 2006.
