Denmark (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports three separate outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N8) on the island of Zealand in Denmark.  On November 14th, three mute swans were found dead in the town Kalvehave, Vordingborg Municipality.  Also on that date, two tufted ducks were found dead near the town Faxe Ladeplads, Faxe Municipality.  The third outbreak occurred on November 19: it affected a mixed backyard poultry flock, and is described below, in the “Poultry” section.  This series of outbreaks is believed to have been caused by contact with wild species; control measures include movement control inside the country, traceability, stamping out, zoning, disinfection/disinfestation, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, and surveillance within containment and/or protection zones.  Testing was conducted by the National Veterinary Institute in Kalvehave.
