H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
A joint statement from the Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization reported that a seven-year-old girl from Prey Veng province died on June 7 from respiratory complications arising from bird flu. The patient became ill on May 24 and was hospitalized May 31. She is the sixteenth recorded person from Cambodia to have become infected with H5N1 bird flu since 2005 and the fourteenth to have died from the disease. Philippe Buchy, head of virology at the Pasteur Institute in Phnom Penh, said, “Usually, by the end of April, the virus stops circulating among poultry stock. But this year, for an unknown reason, the virus is still circulating.” It is thought that the girl caught the virus by eating infected poultry. According to the joint statement, the Health Ministry plans to train clinicians in “high-risk provinces” to detect bird flu in the early stages of infection. Health officials have collected samples from 65 people in the girl’s village, all of whom tested negative for bird flu.
