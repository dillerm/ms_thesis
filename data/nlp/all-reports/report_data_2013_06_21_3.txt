H7N7 in Poultry in Africa
The deputy director for animal health in the Western Cape department of agriculture confirmed six outbreaks of the low-pathogenic H7N7 virus at ostrich farms near the town of Oudtshoorn this week. The farms have been quarantined to prevent the disease from spreading further. Additionally, officials are urging farmers to enforce biosecurity measures including separating ostriches from all other birds, keeping ostriches away from open pans and swampy areas, and keeping their water clean and fresh.
