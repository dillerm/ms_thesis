H5N1 in Wild Birds in Hong Kong:
The second wild bird in   Hong Kong found positive for H5N1 this year was a crested goshawk (Accipiter   trivirgatus) found dead on January 9, 2007, near a health clinic in Shek Kip   Mei, Hong Kong. Lo Wing-lok, a member of the Hong Kong legislature and an   infectious disease expert, speculates that the goshawk became infected after   eating H5N1-infected birds like the scaly-breasted munia (Lonchura punctulata) from Hong Kong that had tested positive on January 6. Â Since   January 14, 72 dead finches have been found at in various parts   of the city and have been sent for laboratory testing.
