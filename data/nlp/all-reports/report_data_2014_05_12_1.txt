Antarctica.
In a recently published article in mBio, a journal of the American Society for Microbiology, scientists reported that a new kind of bird flu has been detected in Antarctica in Adelie penguins. After collecting blood samples from about 300 penguins, scientists found that about 3% of the birds were infected with the H11N2 avian influenza virus (AIV), and all of the viruses were quite similar to each other. While the virus does not cause the penguins to become ill, scientists are still puzzled as to “how often AIVs are being introduced into Antarctica, whether it is possible for highly pathogenic AIVs to be transferred there, what animals or ecosystems are maintaining the virus, and whether the viruses are being cryopreserved [when cells are preserved by freezing] during the winters.”
