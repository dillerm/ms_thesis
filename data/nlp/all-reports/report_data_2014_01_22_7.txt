Avian Influenza in Humans in Canada (HPAI H5N1)
 In hopes to further advance H5N1 research, Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory “has isolated live H5N1 virus from respiratory specimens taken from an Alberta woman who died recently from infection of that bird flu virus.”  The woman died on January 3 after contracting the virus during a three-week trip to China in December.  This was the first appearance of the virus in North America.  Scientists hope that by isolating the virus, they will be able to learn more about the virus and how it is spread, as the victim did not come in contact with poultry while in China.  Initial analysis of the strain shows that it resembles the H5N1 virus previously identified in China.
