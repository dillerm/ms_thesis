H5N1 in Humans in Vietnam
A three-year-old boy from Dong Thap province tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. There are conflicting reports on how the boy was exposed; the family may have raised chickens that died recently. There are also duck farms near his home that have been affected by H5N1. The boy had eaten either the chicken or duck prior to developing symptoms. He died on Mar 19. Four people have been infected with bird flu in Vietnam this year and the virus has been blamed for two deaths.
