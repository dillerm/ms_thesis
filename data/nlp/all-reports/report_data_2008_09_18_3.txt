H5N1 in Poultry in Togo
Samples from the bird flu outbreak in Agbata last week have been confirmed by labs in Ghana and Italy as H5N1.  The outbreak occurred near the capital of Lome, but it is still unknown how many birds died in the outbreak, though the originating farm housed almost 4,500 chickens.
