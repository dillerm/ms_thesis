H5N1 in Wild birds
Recent research by scientists from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Indonesia has shown that outbreaks of H5N1 are closely related to the migration of wild birds. They presented their research at the fifth regional meeting of the Asian Partnership on Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (APEIR). According to Lei Fumin, researcher of Institute of Zoology with Chinese Academy of Sciences, the research team studied avian influenza outbreaks along the bird migration routes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Their study indicated that outbreaks often coincide with migration patterns in time and location. Lakes and wetlands were found to be of particular importance in the transmission of influenza viruses. The research showed that the role of wild birds in the transmission of bird flu requires attention. Dr. Witthawat Wiriyarat from Thailand, who joined the research team, proposed to form a regional surveillance network to monitor avian influenza viruses in migratory birds. The discovery of large quantities of migratory bird carcasses in some of the lakes around the plateau in 2005 caused scientists to investigate the role of migratory birds in the transmission of bird flu.
