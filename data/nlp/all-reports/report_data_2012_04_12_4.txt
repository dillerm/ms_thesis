H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
Officials from the Health Ministry and World Health Organisation (WHO) announced that a six-year-old girl from Kampong Chhnang province died on March 30 from H5N1 bird flu. The girl fell ill after eating meat from a sick chicken and her family attempted to treat her with medicine and injections. When she did not get better, on March 28, they sent her to Kuntha Bopha hospital for treatment. This is the first human case of H5N1 influenza reported in Kampong Chhnang province and the second death from bird flu in Cambodia this year.
