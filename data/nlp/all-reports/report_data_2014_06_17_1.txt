According to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report, a sample of the low-pathogen H9N2 avian influenza virus sent to the U.S. Department of Agriculture Southeast Poultry Rresearch Laboratory (SEPRL) in Athens, GA was contaminated with the highly pathogenic H5N1 bird flu virus. The shipment was received in March, and personnel at SEPRL notified the CDC in May that the samples had been contaminated. The CDC confirmed that the samples had been unintentionally cross-contaminated and the contaminated sample and associated items at the Athens lab were destroyed. In addition to halting operations and shipments, the CDC has started an investigation to determine what led to the contamination.
