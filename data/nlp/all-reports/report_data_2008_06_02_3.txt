H5N1 in Humans in Bangladesh
A 16-month-old boy is the first human H5N1 case reported in Bangladesh, the director of the Institute of Epidemiology and Disease Control and Research in Dhaka said. The boy's infection, which occurred in January, was only detected during a routine check-up; he has since recovered. He lives in a poor district of Dhaka and was exposed to live and slaughtered chickens around his home. H5N1 was first reported in Bangladesh in March 2006 and has since spread to 47 of the countryâ€™s 64 districts.
