Hong Kong (HPAI H5N6)
A peregrine falcon found dead at a construction site on 4/9 has tested positive for HPAI H5N6. This is the first time that HPAI H5N6 has been found in a wild bird. The location of the construction site is located near the Ma Po Nature Reserve, but it is unclear if that is where the falcon was exposed.
