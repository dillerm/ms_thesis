H5N1 in Poultry in Vietnam
Bird flu has been detected in a household flock of ducks in Ca Mau province. The outbreak began on March 16, according to the Vietnamese Department of Animal Health. In Lang Son province, 24 of 104 samples from illegally imported chickens have tested positive for H5N1, the Lang Son Animal Health Department said. Â Since the beginning of the year, some 60 tons of illegal poultry have been confiscated, but authorities acknowledge that this is only a tiny portion of what is smuggled. Around 800 ducks have died in new outbreaks of bird flu in Quang Nam provinces' Nui Thanh district, where a third of the dead ducks had been vaccinated two weeks ago. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development said they will investigate the immune status of vaccinated birds in Ha Noi and in 28 cities and provinces. A total of eight provinces are currently affected, including Ca Mau, Ha Noi, Lao Cai, Quang Binh, Quang Nam, Quang Tri, Tuyen Quang, and Soc Trang. (more...)
