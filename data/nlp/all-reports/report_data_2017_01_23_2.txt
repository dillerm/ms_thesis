Uganda (HPAI H5)
A news report dated January 16 stated that mass mortality of wild birds (white-winged black terns) has been observed in a bird sanctuary on the shore of Lake Victoria, and that highly pathogenic avian influenza of the H5 subtype has been confirmed as the cause of the die-off.  The strain of AI involved in the mass deaths is unclear, but some of the birds had migrated from Europe, suggesting a possible link to the H5N8 outbreak occurring on that continent.  Some domestic fowl have also been affected.
