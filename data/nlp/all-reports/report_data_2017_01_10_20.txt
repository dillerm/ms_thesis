UK (HPAI H5N8)
A report dated January 3 describes an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza in a backyard flock of ducks and chickens in Carmarthenshire County, Wales.  As reported previously, H5N8 was detected in December in a dead wild duck in this county.  To prevent further spread of the disease, a 3-km protection zone and 10-km surveillance zone were established around the site; in addition, poultry keepers are required to keep their animals indoors or otherwise ensure their separation from wild birds.  The protection zone will stay in place until February 28.
