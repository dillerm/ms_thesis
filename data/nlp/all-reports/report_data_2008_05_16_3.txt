H5N1 in Poultry in South Korea
Four new confirmed H5N1 outbreaks were reported this week by the Ministry of Food, Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, and include locations in the Gyeonggi and North and South Gyeongsang provinces and Busan metropolitan area. H5 avian influenza has been found at an illegal farm in South Korea's capital Seoulâ€™s Songpa district. Whether the strain is H5N1 remains to be determined. Analysis found that the birds at the farm were purchased at the same traditional market at Seongnam, Gyeonggi province, as those in the aviary in Gwanglin, where H5N1 was confirmed last week. The farm in Songpa is located less than 5 km from the market. A total of 8,200 ducks and chickens have been culled on the farm. On May 12, the Seoul Metropolitan Government announced that all poultry in Seoul will be culled to curb the spread of bird flu. More than 6.8 billion chickens and ducks have been culled nationwide since April at an estimated loss of $478 million (US dollars). Despite these measures, the agriculture ministry has reported 40 cases of bird flu at 31 locations so far and some are asking whether the virus has become endemic in the country. (more...)
