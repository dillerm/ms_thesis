Russia (HPAI H5N1)
According to a World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE), a new case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus has been reported in a dead whooper swan found at Ingren Lake, located in a park in the Chitinsky Raion (district) of the Zabaykalsky Krai.  Control of wildlife reservoirs, movement controls inside the country, and screening measures have been put in place to prevent the virus from spreading.  The source of the outbreak is unknown. The sequence of the hemagglutin gene of the whooper swan virus showed that it was most closely related to other H5N1 isolates from Tuva and Astrakhan this year.
