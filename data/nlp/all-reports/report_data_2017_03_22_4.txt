Malaysia (HPAI H5N1)
Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been detected in Kelantan State, in the northern part of West (Peninsular) Malaysia.  The outbreak was first detected on 6 March, in backyard poultry in a small village; authorities implemented control measures (including culling at least 170 chickens), and initially believed it was contained in that area.  However, the virus has subsequently been detected in at least 20 more villages, and 24,000 birds have been culled in an renewed effort to control the spread of the virus.  Backyard poultry have been affected thus far, but none in commercial farms as of 16 March. The H5N1 strain of avian influenza has been known to infect humans in the past (although it is not known to be transmitted well from person to person), and villagers are being screened; so far no human cases have been found.  The source of the outbreak is unknown, but it may have been imported into the area by birds transported for cockfighting.
