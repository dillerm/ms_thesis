Other Avian Influenza Strains in Poultry in USA
 Recently, OIE reported that 3,000 poultry birds in Polk County, Missouri, have been exposed to low pathogenic avian influenza (H7N3) virus.  The birds are from 14,000 19-week-old turkeys and 16,000 5-week-old turkeys, all of which were located at a two-shed contract commercial turkey operation.  At the time of the report, all of the birds were still alive, and had not shown any signs of sickness.  Samples were collected as part of routine pre-slaughter surveillance for the National Poultry Improvement Plan (NPIP) Avian Influenza Clean Program (H5 and H7).  The older birds are market-ready and are being processed and the younger turkeys will be destroyed and buried on site. The Missouri H5/H7 LPAI Initial State Response and Containment plan has been implemented as a precautionary measure.
