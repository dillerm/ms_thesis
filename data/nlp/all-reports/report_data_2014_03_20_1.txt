Avian Influenza in Wild birds in South Korea (H5N8).
Korean officials confirmed that a dead bean goose found in the city of Gwacheon in Gyeonggi province tested positive for H5N8. To prevent the disease from spreading, restricted access has been enforced within 10-kilometers of where the dead goose was found. Additionally, the city of Seoul has banned the movement of poultry, increased quarantine measures, and the Seoul Zoo which had just reopened two weeks ago from an earlier outbreak is once again closed until further notice.
