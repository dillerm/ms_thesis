H5N1 in Wild Birds in South Korea:
Nial Moores from Birds   Korea, part of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)   mission to South Korea to investigate the H5N1 outbreaks in domestic poultry,   made public his personal observations that there was no evidence of large-scale   wild bird mortality near the H5N1 outbreaks.  During the week-long mission, 2   ducks and 2 rufous (Oriental) turtle doves (Streptopelia orientalis) were   the only dead birds found.  Samples from wild birds, including rook (Corvus frugilegus), greater white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons), and   mallards; collected within 10 km of the outbreaks will be analyzed in South   Korea and Australia. These observations do not necessarily reflect the official   FAO report, which has yet to be released.
