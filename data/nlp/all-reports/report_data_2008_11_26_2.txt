H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
Xinhua newspaper reports that Jakarta officials plan to push market live-poultry sellers out of the city in an effort to prevent avian influenza outbreaks. "As we are closing down their businesses, they will have to find alternative ventures," said Edy Setiarto, head of Jakarta's Husbandry, Fisheries and Maritimes Agency. Vendors would have to shut down their operations completely and not be allowed to sell live chickens in or to traditional markets by April, 2010. It is unknown if the vendors will be compensated for business losses. Only two poultry plants, both run by a private agency, will be permitted to distribute chicken meat to traditional markets. "The move was part of measures to implement a 2007 poultry-restriction bylaw aimed at controlling the sale of poultry in Jakarta," said Setiarto. The bylaw attempted to halt future outbreaks of bird flu in Indonesia which has the largest number of human cases in the world. Early this week, chickens were found dead in a neighborhood in Sulawesi district where the 17 people fell ill with flu-like symptoms in mid-November.  All 17 have been cleared of having bird flu, but the chickens have been confirmed as being positive for avian influenza.  It is estimated that bird flu may infect close to 50% of the poultry sold in markets throughout Jakarta, Banten and West Java.
