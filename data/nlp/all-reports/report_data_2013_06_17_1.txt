H5N1 in Wild birds in Austria
Austrian authorities had to cull dozens of rare birds that had been smuggled into Europe by a Czech couple from Bali, Indonesia, after it was discovered that one of the dead birds contained the H5N1 virus. In total, the couple smuggled 60 birds, including wild parrots, birds of paradise, and other exotic species, into the country in suitcases. Thirty-nine birds died while being transported, while the remaining 21 were culled to prevent the disease from spreading further. The couple will be prosecuted and Austrian border guards reported that everyone who had come in contact with the birds had been treated and had shown no flu-like symptoms.
