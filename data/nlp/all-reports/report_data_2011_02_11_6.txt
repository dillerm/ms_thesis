H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
Around 20,000 birds has died in West Kalimantan province. Samples of dead chicken tested positive H5N1 bird flu. Head of Livestock Service and Animal Health of West Kalimantan, Abdul Manaf Mustafa said that the virus presumably entered West Kalimantan from other islands, as there are many local ports that are difficult to inspect. To prevent the further spread of the virus, the Livestock Service isolated Mepawah area by enhancing monitoring and applying bio-security in two locations, inspecting the transportation of poultry and poultry products, and disinfecting transportation vehicles.
