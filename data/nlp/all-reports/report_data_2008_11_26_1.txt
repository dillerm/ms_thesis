H5N1 in Wild birds
According to Pakistani newspaper, The Nation, migratory birds cannot be held responsible for the outbreak of bird flu in any part of the world. After a comprehensive review of FAO studies and other scientific literature, evidence shows that the poultry trade impacts the spread of avian influenza, not migrating wild birds. However, according to the Indian newspaper, The Hindu, FAO has not ruled out the possibility that wild birds can spread H5N1, and a project is beginning that will track migrating birds to gauge their role in the global dispersal of the disease. While H5N1 mainly attacks poultry, a global study commissioned by the FAO has found incidence of bird flu in migratory birds in various parts of the world. Using bird banding, researchers will try to discover the basic study of the behavior of migratory birds that may or may not be carrying avian influenza. Bird-lovers in Japan are being urged to stop feeding wild birds for fear that large flocks of migrating birds will be attracted to the food. Earlier this year bird flu was detected in swans in the Tohoku region, and congregations of birds could possibly create conditions where H5N1 could spread more quickly. Some birding enthusiasts are afraid that the birds will not have enough to eat after becoming dependent on the feed from people.
