H5N1 in Poultry in Romania
On March 27 the veterinary and food safety authority announced a second outbreak of H5N1 in the county of Tulcea. Two chickens in a village on the border with Ukraine had symptoms consistent with bird flu and the entire flock raised by the household has been culled to prevent the spread of the disease. "No other sick birds were found in the rest of the village and no wild birds have been found dead in the area," sanitary authorities said. Samples from the two ill chickens will be sent to Weybridge Laboratory in Britain for testing. A confirmed outbreak of bird flu occurred on another farm in Tulcea county two weeks ago. During that outbreak 49 birds were found dead and surveillance and disinfection measures were taken to prevent the spread of the disease.
