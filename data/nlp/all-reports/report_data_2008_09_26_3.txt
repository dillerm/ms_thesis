H5N1 in Poultry in Iraq
The Duhok veterinary office has culled 50,000 chicks from two hatcheries following the discovery of the H9 strain of avian influenza. Luqman Tayeb Omer, the general director of the Duhok Veterinary Office, said that the virus likely came from Mosul as the districts of Al-Hamdaniya, Shalalat and Talkef are known to be infected.  While the strain is not H5N1, discovery of the H9 strain shows Iraq's continued surveillance of the disease.
