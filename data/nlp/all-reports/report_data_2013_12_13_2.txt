China (H7N9)
The Health and Family Planning Commission of Guangdong has reported three new human cases of H7N9 in recent weeks. The first individual, a 36-year-old domestic helper, may have contracted the virus from one of the markets in Shenzhen that was recently found to be infected with H7N9. The second patient, an 80-year-old male, had also recently visited Shenzhen, but had not directly handled any live birds. In the third case, a 30-year-old man from Zhejiang, who is the son-in-law of an earlier confirmed case was found infected with H7N9. Whether he became infected by person-to-person transmission or by exposure to infected poultry is not known. The commission is warning that the risk of the bird flu spreading in the province is high and has urged the public to stay alert.
