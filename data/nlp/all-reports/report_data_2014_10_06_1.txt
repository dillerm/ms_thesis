Avian Influenza in Poultry in Russia (HPAI H5N1)
Russia has reported the first cases of a highly pathogenic bird flu virus in nearly two years in villages in Southern Russia, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and the Russian Ministry of Agriculture.  Infections with the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 serotype of the virus were found in flocks of domestic chickens, geese, and ducks in two villages in the Altai Krai region near the border with Kazakhstan. In one village, 36 birds (species not specified) in a flock of 1952 had died and in the second village 286 birds died in a flock of 793 birds. Birds were destroyed in the two villages according to the OIE reports. The report further comments that hunter-harvested duck and geese “trophies” had been displayed in backyards where the domestic bird mortality subsequently occurred.   The last occurrence of the HPAI H5N1 strain in Russia was in December 2012.
