H5N1 in Poultry in Cambodia
An outbreak of bird flu was found on a farm in Kandal Steung District, close to a human case that occurred in early December.  The human case (Cambodia's first case in 2008, and its eighth total case) involved a 19 year-old man who became infected with avian influenza after contact with a dead chicken that had been raised at his home. He eventually recovered following hospitalization.  The current farm outbreak involved the deaths of 40 ducks and 80 chickens, and resulted in the subsequent culling of 344 birds.
