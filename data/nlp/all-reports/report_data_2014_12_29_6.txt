Taiwan (LPAI H5) in Jiaoxi Township, Yilan County
H7N9 subtype LPAI was confirmed on 16 December 2014 from a wild bird fecal sample in a wetland. The gene sequence of the H7N9 subtype LPAI is different from China's strain. Subsequently, intensified active surveillance within 3 km-radius of the aforementioned wetland detected H5 avian influenza virus (AIV) in a duck breeder farm with 2600 birds. The gene sequence analysis of the HA0 cleavage site of the H5 RNA demonstrated that the causal agent was of low pathogenicity. Movement restriction was implemented on the duck breeder farm. Clinical investigation on the affected farm showed that the ducks were in healthy condition without abnormal mortality and egg production. The clinical investigation and surveillance of surrounding poultry farms are ongoing.
