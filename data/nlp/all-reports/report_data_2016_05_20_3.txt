Indonesia (HPAI H5N1)
Data from the Agriculture Ministry show 148 cases of avian influenza in Indonesia in the first 4 months of the year.  This is a significant increase, considering in 2015 only 123 cases were reported.  The Director of Animal Health Services at the Agriculture Ministry cites a lack of public awareness as the main reason for the spread of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus.  This, coupled with lowered poultry immunity due to the El Nino effect, make the threat of a more widespread avian influenza epidemic more imminent.
