H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
On August 25, H5N1 bird flu infected 60 chickens on a farm in East Java province. The owner reported that he had noticed the death of some chickens awhile ago, but had put off reporting the incident to the Livestock Service. After more chickens died, he reported the case and tests showed that the chickens were infected with bird flu. The Livestock Service has disinfected the area to prevent the spread of the disease.
