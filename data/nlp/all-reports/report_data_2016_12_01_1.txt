Croatia (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports a recurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N8) in Croatia.  Five mute swans were found dead on November 12, on the River Drava in Osijek-Baranja County in western Croatia.  This follows a report of ten mute swans found dead on the Bidj River, in the adjacent Vukovar-Srijem County, on October 30.  As a control measure, exhibitions, fairs, and sports competitions for poultry and birds have been prohibited throughout Croatia.  In addition, poultry owners throughout the country have been advised to keep their animals indoors, and owners within three kilometers of the locations where the infected wild birds were found are required to do so.  The cause of the outbreak is unknown.  Testing was conducted by the Poultry Centre of the Crotatian Veterinary Institute in Zagreb.
