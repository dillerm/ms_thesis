Avian Influenza in Humans in Egypt (HPAI H5N1)
According to the health ministry, a 65-year-old woman from the central province of Assiut has died from highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza.  Seven other cases are currently being treated and three have recovered this year, the ministry said.  The cases have mostly been in poor rural areas in the south, where villagers tend to keep and slaughter poultry at home.  Contrary to recent claims, the World Health Organization (WHO) said this week that there does not appear to have been any major genetic change in the influenza strain to explain the recent rise in human cases in Egypt. A total of 18 cases have been reported to WHO since Dec 4, making December 2014 the highest number of human cases ever reported in a single month in Egypt.
