H5N1 in Poultry in Hong Kong
Two dead chickens have tested positive for bird flu at a farm in the Yuen Long District in Hong Kong bordering China. Some 100 breeding and sentinel chickens died and tested positive for H5N1 on December 7th, according to Thomas Sit, Assistant Director of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. Sentinel birds are left unvaccinated as sensitive monitor for H5N1, but the death of previously vaccinated birds raises concern about whether the vaccine used by Hong Kong has lost its efficacy. York Chow, the secretary for food and health said that a total of 80,000 birds within 3 km of the farm will be culled and a 21 day ban on importing poultry would include Christmas, a time when demand is traditionally elevated. Chicken traders said that fertilized eggs smuggled from mainland China may have been the source of the outbreak.
