H5N1 in Wild Birds
OIE, the World Organization for Animal Health, said this week that H5N1 is  infecting fewer wild birds than it has in the past and suggests that the virus  may be dying out in wild birds. "In the first half of 2007, countries  reported fewer deaths of wild and migratory birds, which could indicate the disease  is coming closer to the end of a cycle," Bernard Vallat, Director General  of the OIE said. At the same time the organization noted that transmission of  H5N1 among poultry flocks continues unabated in certain countries.
