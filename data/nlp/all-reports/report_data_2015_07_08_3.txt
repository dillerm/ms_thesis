Ghana (HPAI H5N1)
According to a World Organisation for Animal Health report, an additional case of the highly pathogenic H5N1 has been discovered at a chicken farm in Obuasi, Ashaniti Province. This is the first time that the virus has spread beyond the Greater Accra region since the current outbreaks began in April. 1,302 birds died and the remaining 635 were culled to prevent further spread of the disease. In addition to culling, the farm has been quarantined and movement control measures put in place.
