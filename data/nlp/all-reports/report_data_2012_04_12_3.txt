Ireland (LPAI)
On March 29, strain of bird flu was detected in a flock of 153 pheasants that were caught wild, imported on March 10, and penned prior to release for a gun club in Cork. A total of 8 birds were infected with the disease and 3 of them died. The remaining 150 birds were culled as a precautionary measure. Tests at the Central Veterinary Research Laboratory revealed that the birds were positive for low pathogenic H5N2 bird flu. It is thought that the pheasants contracted the disease through contact with wild species while they were penned since laboratory evidence indicated that the birds had been infected after they were imported. Other precautionary measures, such as movement control, a 1-km exclusion zone, and disinfection of the premises.
