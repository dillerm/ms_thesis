The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports outbreaks of a new strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza that killed 1,148 commercial layers at 2 poultry farms in Tehran. An additional 248,834 birds were destroyed. These outbreaks were detected during ongoing avian influenza surveillance in the region. The outbreak was confirmed through laboratory testing and necropsy. Control measures include ongoing surveillance, screening, disinfection/disinfestation, quarantine, stamping out, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, surveillance within containment and/or protection zone, control of wildlife reservoirs, and zoning. Vaccination is prohibited and there is no treatment of affected animals. 523,000 birds in a 3km radius of the farms with negative test results were slaughtered as a preventative measure. Surveillance will begin outside the containment and protection zones.
