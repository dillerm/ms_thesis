USA (HPAI H5N2/H5N8)
The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and other agencies have tested samples from more than 43,000 wild birds since July, looking for evidence of Eurasian strains of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus and their reassorted descendants.  The last HPAI H5 sample was from a mallard sampled in Utah on July 31, 2015.  Between late 2014 and mid-2015, the Eurasian HPAI H5 strains was present in 15 states.  The less severe North American strains of avian influenza have been present this year, but no evidence of the circulation of the introduced Eurasian strains have been found this fall and winter.
