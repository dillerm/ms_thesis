Vietnam (H5N1)
 Health officials confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 at a duck farm in the Vietnamese Province of Bac Lieu on December 28.  All 1,500 ducks were destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading.  Health officials in the country remain on high alert, as Tet, the Vietnamese New Year celebration, is just around the corner and poultry consumption increases.
