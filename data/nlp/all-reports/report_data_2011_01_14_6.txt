UK (H1N1)
Testing has confirmed that turkeys on a farm in Cheshire are infected with H1N1 flu virus. The strain is closely similar to the human pandemic H1N1 strain currently circulating. After a thorough health risk assessment, the Health Protection Agency reported that there was no risk to public health. The birds were tested after showing mild signs of disease and their health improved during the investigation. Restrictions on the farm have been lifted because there is no food safety risk. Pandemic H1N1, in common with avian influenza, has not been shown to be transmissible to people through eating properly handled and cooked poultry meat, products and eggs. UK researchers announced on Thursday (1/13) that they have genetically engineered a chicken which prevents shedding of the bird flu virus following infection. The chickens express a small RNA that competitively bind to the virusâ€™s RNA polymerase preventing the virus from replicating. The researchers noted that while the birds themselves still get sick, they no longer shed virus.
