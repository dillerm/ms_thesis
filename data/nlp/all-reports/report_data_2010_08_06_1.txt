H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
The local husbandry and fishery administration of East Jakarta has culled 524 chickens, 345 ducks, and 440 pigeons to prevent the spread of bird flu.  In addition to culling the birds, officers dismantle and burn poultry cages that are within 25 meters (82 feet) of residential areas in accordance with a bylaw that prohibits raising poultry near residences. Officers also cull birds that are roaming in residential areas.On July 27 and 28, thousands of chickens died suddenly from H5N1 bird flu in two villages in South Sulawesi province. The Livestock Service immediately culled all of the surviving chickens, disinfected the area, and restricted the traffic of livestock and livestock products in the area to prevent the spread of the disease. They also supplied masks, protective clothing, disinfectant and veterinarians to the locations. People were asked to report any sudden death in birds to bird flu centers that have been built in each sub-district.In Lampung province, about 25 chickens that had died suddenly tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The head of the livestock division of the Agriculture and Livestock Service of Kabupaten Pesawaran, Emi Yeni Erniati, said that Livestock Services and Participatory Disease Surveillance and Response (PDSR) had taken care of this incident. People had been disposing of dead chickens in rivers, but during flooding the carcasses flowed back to the residences and spread the disease. Nevertheless, the number of bird flu cases in the area has decreased since last month.
