LPAI H7N1 in Poultry in South Africa
 The Western Cape ministry of agriculture confirmed an H7N1 outbreak has affected an ostrich farm in the town of Oudtshoorn earlier this week, leading to an “intensive epidemiological investigation” throughout the surrounding area.  While scientists believe that this current outbreak has no connections to the deadly Chinese strain, they are performing tests to be certain.  Additionally, movement restrictions have been put into place and people are advised to report dead and sick birds to the state veterinarian as soon as possible.
