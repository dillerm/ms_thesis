Avian Influenza in Humans in Hong Kong (LPAI H7N9).
On March 3, Hong Kong health officials confirmed two new H7N9 cases. The victims, a 5-year-old girl from the Guangdong province and a 2-year-old girl from the Zhejian province, have both been hospitalized and are being treated. The 2-year-old girl, who had visited mainland China with her family, went to a live-bird market on February 24 and is expected to make a full recovery. “Officials said they expect the prevalence of influenza to increase throughout the winter season and asked the public to take precautions against infection.” Additionally, two families are being isolated at Queen Elizabeth Hospital after a two-year-old boy was placed in a bed next to the girl from Zhejian who was infected with the H7N9 virus. The young girl has recovered, and she and her family have been sent home. The young boy and his family have to be isolated for 10 days to ensure that they do not have the virus.
