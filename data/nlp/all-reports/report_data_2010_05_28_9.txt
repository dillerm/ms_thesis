H5N1 in Poultry in UK (low path)
On May 18 British officials reported a suspected (H5) bird flu test result on a duck farm in Nottingshire. The possible positive sample was found through programs of active surveillance for notifiable avian influenza in domestic poultry. Further investigations were conducted based upon clinical examination and sampling for virological testing to rule out active infection. An investigation was completed with negative results and restrictions on the farm were lifted.
