USA (HPAI H5N2) in Wisconsin
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has confirmed the first case of the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus in Wisconsin.  The outbreak occurred in a commercial flock in Jefferson County with 200,000 chickens.  This also marks the first time the strain has infected chicken; previously, it had only infected turkey flocks. Two additional outbreaks were reported at a backyard flock with 40 mixed breed birds in Juneau County and a commercial turkey flock with 126,000 birds in Barron County two days later.  H5N2 has been confirmed in the Barron case, but the complete identification has yet to be completed in the H5 virus in Juneau. In addition to culling and quarantine, surveillance and testing are underway at nearby properties to ensure the virus has not spread.
