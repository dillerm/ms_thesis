H5N1 in Humans in Egypt
A five-year-old girl from the governorate of Sohag has been infected with H5N1. She was admitted to a hospital on May 9 and has been placed on antiviral therapy. A recent paper in Eurosurveillance found that in Egypt, children 10 or younger make up 48% of reported cases, almost twice the rate elsewhere in the world. Moreover, females account for twice as many cases as males and 90% of the fatalities in Egypt have been females.
