H5N1 in Humans in USA
A different strain, H3N2, of swine flu was detected in a child in Riley County, Kansas. The child fully recovered after a mild illness and no other cases have been reported, although an investigation is underway. The strain is different from the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus and is rarely seen in humans. Jason Eberhart-Phillips, Kansas State Health Officer and Director of Health at the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE), stated “It is critical for people to understand that this H3N2 virus is not related to the pandemic H1N1 virus, this is not a mutation or a recombination of the pandemic strain, and it does not appear at this time to be a threat to human health.” The child likely contracted the disease through contact with pigs at the Riley county fair. It is rare for humans to contract swine influenza viruses, but the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) receive an average of one report each year. The number has slightly increased in recent years and the increased number this year is probably the result of more frequent influenza testing because of the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus.
