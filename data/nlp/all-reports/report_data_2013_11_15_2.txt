Cambodia (HPAI H5N1)
The Cambodian Health Ministry and the World Health Organization released a joint statement confirming two new human cases of H5N1: a 29-year-old male from Pailin province and a 3-year-old boy from Kampong Speu province. Investigators have found that both individuals recently handled sick or dead poultry. The 29-year-old man died last week, and is Cambodiaâ€™s 33rd death from the virus out of 47 total cases. The 3-year-old boy is currently in critical condition. Health Minister Mam Bunheng is urging people to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and to make sure to wash thoroughly with soap and water after all contact with poultry.
