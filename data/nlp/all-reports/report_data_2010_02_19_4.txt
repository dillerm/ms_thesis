The woman had symptoms such as high fever, coughing, and difficulty breathing, and had reportedly been in direct contact with chickens that died suddenly. According to her husband, thousands of chickens near their home, including 15 of their own, died recently. Laboratory tests of the dead chickens showed that they were infected with bird flu. Doctors are awaiting tests results to determine whether or not the patient has bird flu, but have encouraged citizens to be cautious even if the results come back negative because the area is at risk for bird flu.
