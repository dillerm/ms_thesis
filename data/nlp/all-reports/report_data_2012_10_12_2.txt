H7N1 in Poultry in South Africa
During a recent routine examination for highly pathogenic avian influenza, cases of the low pathogenic avian influenza H7N1 virus were identified in Camdeboo, a municipality of the Eastern Cape in South Africa, and Oudtshoorn, a town in the Western Cape province of South Africa. To date, 3,890 birds have been potentially affected and 90 have been culled to prevent the spread of the disease. The source of these outbreaks remains inconclusive. To help reduce the risk of more outbreaks, quarantine, movement control, screening, and disinfection of poultry have been applied.
