Avian Influenza in Wild Animals in USA (Canine Influenza)
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that two strains of the virus including H3N8 and H3N2 can infect dogs. The virus is not known to infect humans but it can infect cats. The H3N8 strain originated in horses and was first identified in greyhounds in Florida in 2004. The H3N8 strain is the cause of a multi-state outbreak in dogs this summer centered on the southern states. But on July 6, 2017, 32 cases were confirmed in Minnesota. The H3N2 strain originated in birds and eventually adapted to infect dogs. It was identified for the first time in dogs in 2007 in South Korea and was found in the United States in 2015. Signs that a dog is infected include cough, runny nose, fever, lethargy, eye discharge, and reduced appetite. Canine influenza spreads through the air or virus cells left on surfaces. A vaccine is available for both strains of canine influenza in the United States.
