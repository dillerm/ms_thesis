H5N1 in Wild birds in Japan
A total of 36 birds, including 22 hooded cranes, 4 white-necked cranes, and 10 wild ducks of unspecified species, were found dead in Izumi Crane Park between December 18 and January 18. A total of 6 dead hooded cranes, including one that was reported on Dec 22, 2010, have tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. There have been no signs of any accelerated spread of the infection such as massive deaths of wild birds or a sudden increase in the number of weak birds in the sanctuary. A total of 1,197 bird feces samples collected in the sanctuary between December 25 and December 27 were negative for bird flu.On December 19, Hokkaido University confirmed that isolates from two of the seven dead tufted ducks found in Fukushima prefecture tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. The ducks were collected at a water reservoir in Koriyama city from January 4 to January 10 and tested at the National Institute for Environmental Studies in Tsukuba, Ibaraki prefecture. The prefecture set up a response center on January 19 and began sending inspectors clad in protective suits to 59 poultry farms in a 10km radius area that includes neighboring towns. The inspectors are interviewing farmers, looking for signs of contagion, such as changes in the death or egg-laying rates of chickens, and checking that farms have anti-contagion measures in place (such as nets to keep out wild birds) and supplies of disinfectant on hand. Nearby roads are being disinfected to prevent possible contagion from bird droppings, and inspectors are watching for bird corpses in the areas where the ducks migrate. The reservoir where the duck corpses were found has been disinfected, and the prefecture is stepping up observation for wild birds in agricultural water reservoirs in the city.
