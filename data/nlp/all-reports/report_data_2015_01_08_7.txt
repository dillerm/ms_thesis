USA (HPAI H5N2)
The Washington State Department of Agriculture has established an emergency quarantine on eggs, poultry, and poultry products in a 20 mile area near two locations in Benton County where H5N2 avian influenza was found in two backyard flocks of chickens, turkeys, ducks and guinea fowl in the past two weeks.  More than 700 birds have died or been euthanized.  The quarantine also applies to pheasants, partridges, chukars, quail, and grouse.  Birds and poultry products are prohibited from moving within the quarantine areas as well as outside of it.  Businesses can get exemptions from the quarantine if they can show they have strong biosecurity measures.
