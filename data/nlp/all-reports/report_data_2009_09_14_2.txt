H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 19-year-old woman died on September 3 of pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus. She had been 8 months pregnant when she was admitted to the hospital on August 29, but miscarried on September 1. Hospital personnel suspected that she may have been co-infected with H5N1 because a number of birds died suddenly near where she lived. Test results to confirm H5N1 are not yet available. This is the sixth death from pandemic H1N1 (2009) in Indonesia.
