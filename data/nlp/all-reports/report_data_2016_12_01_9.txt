Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports a recurrence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) in samples from a poultry farm in Ikwerre, Rivers State, Nigeria. On November 24, the farm had 800 38-week-old layers, 54 of which died of avian influenza. The remaining 746 birds were culled. Control measures in place include movement control inside the country, disinfection/disinfestation, quarantine, stamping out, and surveillance within containment and/or protection zone.  The cause of the outbreak is unknown, but investigators noted poor biosecurity at the farm.  Testing was conducted by the National Veterinary Research Institute in Vom.
