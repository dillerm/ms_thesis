H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
Health Ministry spokeswoman Siti Fadilah Supari has announced the official existence of two avian influenza deaths from May of this year. The two unrelated women, aged 15 and 34 from Jakarta and Tangerang, developed symptoms in May and died at the beginning of June, but their deaths were not announced due to new Health Ministry policy which no longer publicizes cases as they are known. Delayed publicity of the deaths raises concerns over exposure to other family members during the funeral processes, though no other people appear to be ill.  Of the 243 human deaths from avian influenza H5N1, 110 of them have been from Indonesia, and 31 of 33 provinces tested positive for the deadly strain make it endemic to Bali, Java, Sumatra and S. Sulawesi, though, the Health Minister notes, that deaths in Indonesia have been in a recent decline. (more...)
