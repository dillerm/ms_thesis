Japan (HPAI H5N8)
Japan's Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Ministry has reported that last winter's highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza outbreak was likely introduced by migratory birds from Siberia rather than from people/goods crossing the border from South Korea as previously thought. The conclusion was based on a comparison of samples from the two countries that showed the 2015 Japanese viruses were less similar to Korean H5N8 viruses isolated in the winter of 2014 but were more related to those in January.  The outbreaks in Japan resulted in the culling of 350,000 chickens on poultry farms in Miyazaki, Yamaguchi, Okayama and Saga prefectures.  Measures to stop the virus at the border, such as disinfecting clothing and shoes of persons with contact with livestock, will continue, but additionally,the two countries will share samples and other relevant information.
