Recently, OIE reported 8,342 new cases of H5N1 bird flu in Vietnam: 1,250 cases in Nghia An, Nam Dihn province; 547 cases in Tinh Phong and 210 cases in Dong, Quang Ngai province; 2,000 cases in Nghia An, Nam Dihn province; 887 cases in Tu Son, Hai Phong province; 1,550 cases in Quang Huy, Bihn Dihn province; 1,500 cases in Hoi Yen, Quang Tri province; and 398 cases in Nghi Duc, Nghe An province. A total of 5,147 poultry birds died from the infection. Infections were confirmed by PCR testing. The outbreaks have been attributed to the introduction of new live animals into areas, illegal movement of sick animals, and/or fomites (humans, vehicles, feed, etc.). Control measures have been put in place to control the spread of the virus, including quarantining, culling, limiting movement of animals inside the country, and disinfecting infected premises/establishment(s). Officials also plan to screen poultry, zone affected areas, and vaccinate poultry in response to the outbreaks.
