Laos (HPAIH5N6)
The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported a new case of the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus on a poultry farm in the Xayabury Province.  A total of 314 chickens died and 220 were culled out of 534 birds to prevent further spread of the virus. In addition to culling, the practices of stamping out, quarantine, movement control, and disinfection were carried out.  The source of the outbreak is unknown. H5N6 was previously detected in 2014 in the same province. That outbreak was traced to a shipment of 2-3-day-old chickens from Yunnan, China.
