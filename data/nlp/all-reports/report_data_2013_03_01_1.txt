H5N1 in Wild birds in India
 Government officials in the Indian state of Odisha are on high alert after a confirmed case of bird flu was detected in Chilka Lake earlier this week.  It was not clear from the reports whether this was the detection of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus or some other avian influenza virus. Health officials are especially concerned as Chilka Lake borders the districts of Puri, Khordha, and Ganjam and is “one of the topmost winter homes for migratory birds in the country.”  To help prevent further outbreaks, a rapid action team has been assembled and experts have collected additional blood samples from both migratory birds and chickens from farms in the affected districts and are awaiting test results.  With warmer weather on the way and thousands of birds leaving the area daily, the State Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department is hopeful that no further outbreaks will occur.
