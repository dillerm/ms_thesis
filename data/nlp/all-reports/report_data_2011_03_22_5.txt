H5N1 in Humans in Bangladesh
The Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) confirmed the first case of human infection of H5N1 bird flu in Dhaka on March 14. IEDCR Director Mahmudur Rahman said that infection was confirmed in a 13-month-old girl with a fever who visited an influenza surveillance center run jointly by the IEDCR and International Centre for Diarrheal Diseases and Research, Bangladesh (ICDDR,B). Rahman added that family members of the child were also examined, and that IEDCR was also examining the areas where the child visited with her parents this year.  The girl is currently undergoing treatment in IEDCR supervision.Two days later, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh, confirmed a second case of human infection with H5N1 bird flu in a 16-month-old girl from Kamalapur, Dhaka. The girl had a history of cough and fever (and subsequently recovered) and was admitted to the same influenza sentinel surveillance center on March 8. IEDCR Director Mahmudur Rahman said that this most recent case is not related to the earlier one.  "We are lucky that the strain (clade 2.2) of H5N1, which circulates in Bangladesh, is less virulent, so it causes less infection to humans," Rahman said, adding, "but we have to be careful as it has the potential to change into another class (2.1), which was highly infectious to humans.” The IEDCR is working on ascertaining the source of infection of the second baby.  The institution has urged the public not to panic, but to be aware of the disease and to take protective measures to prevent future outbreaks.
