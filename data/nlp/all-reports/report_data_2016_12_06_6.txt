Romania (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports that highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N8 has been detected in Romania for the first time.  On November 23, a mute swan was found dead in Constanta harbor, on the Black Sea in southeastern Romania.  On November 24, the Institute for Diagnosis and Animal Health (Bucharest) confirmed that H5N8 was present in samples from the swan.  Control measures are in place, and include movement control inside the country, zoning, screening, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, and control of wildlife reservoirs.
