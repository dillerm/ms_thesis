Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported 39 additional cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus on poultry farms in nine states.  Fifteen of the cases occurred in Rivers and ten in Katsina.  The remaining 14 cases were spread among the states of Sokoto, Bauchi, Nasarawa, Lagos, Edo, Enugu, Abia and Oyo.   A total of 29,220 chickens died and 184,725 birds were culled to prevent further spread of the virus. In addition to culling, the practices of modified stamping out, quarantine, movement control, disinfection, and destruction of animal products and disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste were carried out.  The source of the outbreaks are unknown; however, it was noted that poor farm biosecurity existed on some farms, that chicks in some cases were of unknown sources and that farms with birds of different originations shared water. The Cable, a Nigerian news source, reported that avian influenza was responsible for the loss of 60,000 birds alone in August in Lagos.  According to the government's permanent secretary, the disease has been contained and that farmers are being asked to report suspicious bird deaths.  Tests are also being conducted for avian influenza in areas with the disease, birds testing positive are culled. The Nation online news, has said that since January of 2015, H5N1 outbreaks has occurred in 21 Nigeria's 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. The outbreaks have been blamed on poor biosecurity, ignorance of the disease by poultry farmers as well as preventive policies and protocols not being implemented by the states.  To prevent further spread of the virus 1,597,191 birds have been culled and farms are being disinfected.
