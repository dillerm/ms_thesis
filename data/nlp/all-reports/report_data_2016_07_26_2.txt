Those affected include a 61-year-old man in Jiangsu who had poultry exposure, a 54-year-old woman in Anhul with no poultry exposure, and a 52-year-old man who worked in a market in Zhejiang.  The market worker died, and the remaining two patients are listed in serious condition. From 2013 to date, 770 human cases of avian influenza A(H7N9) have been reported by the Mainland health authorities, while since October 2015 to date, 113 have been recorded.

Suspected cases are immediately referred to public hospitals for checkups. The display of posters and broadcasting of health messages is underway.
