Birds on a poultry farm in Thuringen Province are experiencing an outbreak of low pathogenic bird flu that began on November 19. The farm contains 2,420 birds, 25 of which died from the disease and 10 of which have been destroyed. The source of the outbreak is unknown, but the birds tested positive for low pathogenic bird flu at the Friedrich-Loeffler Institute on November 20. Precautions being taken to prevent the spread of the virus include control of wildlife reservoirs, movement control within the country, screening, zoning, and disinfection of the premises. There are plans to cull the rest of the susceptible animals and destroy their carcasses.
