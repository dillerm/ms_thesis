Avian Influenza in Wild birds in South Korea (HPAI H5N8)
  The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed on January 20 that about 60 Baikal teal ducks died of H5N8 in Gochang, North Jeolla Province.  Lab results confirmed that it is the same strain that infected poultry farms throughout the province and led to the culling of 200,000 just days before.  Baikal teal ducks migrate from Sibera to South Korea in November for the winter, and due to the recent outbreaks, scientists believe that these ducks spread the virus to the neighboring farms.  Authorities remain on high alert and have banned the movement of poultry, farm workers, and veterinarians.
