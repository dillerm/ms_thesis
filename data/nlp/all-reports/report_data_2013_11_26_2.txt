Indonesia (HPAI H5N1)
Indonesian health officials confirmed earlier this week that a 31-year-old woman from the West Java Province died after being treated for H5N1. She developed symptoms on November 1, and was treated at various health clinics before H5N1 was diagnosed. She died on November 11. The woman kept chickens in her home and could have come into contact with the 50-60 chickens in her neighborhood. This is the countryâ€™s 163rd bird-flu related death. Due to the Thanksgiving Holiday next week, there will be no Avian Influenza News next week. The reports will resume the week of December 2nd.
