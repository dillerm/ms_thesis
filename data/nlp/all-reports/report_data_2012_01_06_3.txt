H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
 In the Meherpur district of Bangladesh, over 3,000 poultry were culled and 1,300 eggs destroyed after dead chickens tested positive for H5N1 bird flu.  The infection was limited to one poultry farm, but other farms have been alerted about possible bird flu infection.  The owner of the affected poultry farm is the president of the District Poultry Farm Association, had noticed a chicken dying on December 24 and took it in for testing the same day.  More specimens were collected the next day and testing at Dhaka confirmed the birds were infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza.
