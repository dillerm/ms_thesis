H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia.
There have been recent outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu in both West Sumatra and North Sumatra. In West Sumatra, the Agriculture, Livestock and Horticulture Service (Dispernaktura) reported that hundreds of chickens in two districts (Jorong Pandang Durian Hijau and Jorong Padang Lawas) have tested positive for bird flu. The head of the Agriculture, Livestock and Horticulture Service, Jhonniwar, reported on November 9 that laboratory tests run in Bukittinggi on samples taken during a field investigation were positive for H5N1. Flocks within a 500 meter radius of infected areas have been disinfected and infected chickens have been culled to prevent the spread of the disease. In North Sumatra, H5N1 bird flu hit several villages in the Kabupaten Tapsel district. Nearly 2,700 chickens belonging to 200 households died between October 23 and November 2. The Health Service of Tapsel undertook preventative measures such as raising public awareness, disinfection of villages, and vaccination of surviving chickens. In addition, twelve districts in the area have been warned to be aware and maintain farm bio-security. The head of the Agriculture Service of Tapsel reported that no more dead birds have been found since the outbreak ended.
