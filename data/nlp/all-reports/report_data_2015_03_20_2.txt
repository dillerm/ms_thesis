Sweden (HPAI H5N8)
On March 20th, Sweden confirmed that two swans that were found dead in Stockholm tested positive for H5N8. The Swedish Board of Agriculture said the swans probably died from other causes, even though they carried the HPAI virus. This is the same strain that has hit neighboring European countries. "The find in Stockholm will not lead to us taking any precautions other than those that already apply, but of course we pay close attention to any developments," Ingrid Eilertz of Sweden's Board of Agriculture said in a statement. "It is, as always, important that those keeping poultry or other birds are mindful of hygiene and disease protection so that the infection does not spread to their pets," she added.
