H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
 It was recently reported that H5N1 bird flu has spread to Kotamobagu in North Sulawesi. After residents in Desa (village) Kopandakan 1 reported that a number of chickens in the area suddenly died, the Agriculture and Livestock Service of the Bolaang Mongondow district conducted rapid testing on the carcasses, which yielded positive results. The owner of the chickens said that he observed unknown pigeons foraging for leftover chicken feed a day before the chickens died. Following the incident, local officials culled birds in Desa Kopandakan 1.
