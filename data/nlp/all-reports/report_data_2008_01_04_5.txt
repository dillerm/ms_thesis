H5N1 in Poultry in Germany
In the third H5N1 outbreak in less than 10 days, bird flu has been detected among 15 chickens on a farm in Brandenburg near Berlin. The owner, who notified officials on December 24, had also looked after a neighborâ€™s property over the Christmas holidays. The birds on both locations have since been destroyed.
