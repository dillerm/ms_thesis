HIN1 in Pigs and Other Animals in Taiwan
Pigs on a farm in Guanshan Township in eastern Taiwan have tested positive for the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus. The virus from the pigs was found to be identical to the virus currently circulating in people. The pigs are believed to have been infected from a human source as all of the pigs are bred on the farm and none have ever left the facility; however, the workers were tested and none were positive for H1N1.
