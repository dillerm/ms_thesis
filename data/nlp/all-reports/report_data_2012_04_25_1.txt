H5N1 in Wild birds in Israel
 In the city of Bet Dagan in Israel last month, cats were observed eating turkey carcasses infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza. Veterinary Services and Animal Health reported that 2 cats, one sick and one dead, found near the affected turkey pens tested positive for the H5N1 bird flu, and the virus strain in the cats was similar to the strain found in infected turkeys from the Shalwa area in Israel. Two rounds of surveillance of cats caught throughout the village have not identified additional cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza. Continued control measures include movement control, screening, zoning, and disinfection.
