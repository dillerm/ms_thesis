H5N1 in Humans in Egypt
A five-year-old girl from Sohag province has been confirmed positive for bird flu after contact with infected birds. She was admitted to the hospital May 9 and in stable condition after treatment with Tamiflu. A four-year-old boy from the Sharkiya province has contracted bird flu, probably through contact with sick household poultry. He has been treated with Tamiflu and is in stable condition. These cases bring the total number of human cases of bird flu in Egypt to 70. Last month, Egypt ordered the culling of all of the nationâ€™s swine (300,000 to 400,000) as a precaution against the new H1N1 virus.
