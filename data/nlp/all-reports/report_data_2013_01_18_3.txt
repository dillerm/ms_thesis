Mexico (HPAI H7N3).
Two outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza, H7N3, were reported on the 12th of January on two farms in the western Mexican state of Jalisco. Officials from Servicio Nacional de Sanidad, Inocuidad y Calidad Agroalimentaria (SENASICA) are reporting that out of 397,513 birds, 18,009 have died. To help prevent further outbreaks, birds at both farms will be culled. Further control measures include quarantine, movement control, and screening and zoning. The origin of these outbreaks remains unknown, and national surveillance will continue.
