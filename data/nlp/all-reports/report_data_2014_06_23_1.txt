Avian Influenza in Wild birds
A team of researchers led by Yoshihiro Kawaoka of the University of Wisconsin-Madison has found that some genes from influenza viruses recently isolated from wild birds are very similar to those in the devastating 1918 pandemic flu virus, differing by only a few amino acids. The team’s study, recently published in Cell Host and Microbe, explores the risk of avian influenza virus emergence and adaptation to humans, and the potential for a resultant pandemic. According to senior study author Kawaoka, the report’s findings indicate the need for continued surveillance of influenza viruses in wild birds, as well as improved influenza vaccines and antivirals in preparation for a pandemic scenario.
