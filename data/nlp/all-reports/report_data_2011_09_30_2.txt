H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
 After poultry farmers observed dozens of dead chickens in the South Sulawesi Province of Indonesia, tests conducted by the Veterinary Disease Investigation Center showed the chickens were infected with H5N1 bird flu.  To prevent the spread of disease, farmers burned the dead chickens and disinfected the surviving chickens, while officials are isolating the affected area.
