China (HPAI H7N9)
According to officials, environmental testing of poultry stalls at live markets in Zhuhai has revealed a 40% contamination rate of the highly pathogenic avian influenza H7N9 virus.  City CDC officials warn market managers to take precautions, including wearing masks, gloves, and boots, and using cleaning and disinfecting measures.  Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan Provinces have piloted centralized slaughtering, cold chain distribution, and fresh listing.  CDC Deputy Director Li Yurong has suggested Zhuhai should implement these procedures as soon as possible.   Unlike many of the other strains of avian influenza, the H7N9 virus generally produces no symptoms in birds, and can spread silently through poultry populations, often only being noticed when a human becomes infected. A recent study of human cases in Shanghai found that people with chronic disease or frequent visits to wet markets are significantly correlated with infection of H7N9.
