Taiwan (HPAI H5N3)
According to the Animal Health Inspection and Quarantine Institute, the highly pathogenic H5N3 avian influenza virus has been confirmed in three Chinese bulbuls found dead in Miaoli County.  The birds were found within 1 kilometer of a fowl slaughterhouse.  A Naumann's thrush found dead in Pingtung County was also confirmed to be infected with H5 avian influenza.  Pingtung Magistrate Pan Men-an urged the central government for more monitoring of wild birds and control measures, such as putting up nets around fowl farms to prevent wild birds from entering.  Over 520,000 fowl have been culled in the recent outbreak of H5 avian influenza, and officials estimate that 1 million chickens will be culled.
