Taiwan (HPAI H5N2)
Avian influenza has been detected in a duck farm in Taiwan for the first time this year.  This is the sixth outbreak in the country so far, and all previous outbreaks have involved chickens.  Highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza was confirmed in samples from the duck farm, according to a report from January 16; the farm is in Yilan County, northeast Taiwan.  The farm is in an area where other AI strains have been detected this year, and H5N2 was found during a monitoring program instituted because of those detections.
