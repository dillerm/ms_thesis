Taiwan (HPAI H5N8)
The Council of Agriculture has reported an additional case of the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus on a poultry farm in Chiayi County.  A total of 200 ducks died, and 6,000 were culled to prevent further spread of the disease.  In addition to culling, poultry farms in a one kilometer radius of the farm were tested and found to be uncontaminated.  Hatchling farms in a neighboring county are also being tested as possible sources of the outbreak.  According to the Focus Taiwan News Channel, as of August 28, 951 out of 983 poultry farms in Taiwan have tested positive for avian influenza.
