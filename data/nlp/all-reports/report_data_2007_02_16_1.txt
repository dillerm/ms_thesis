H5N1 in Wild Birds in Hong Kong:
Two silver-eared mesia (Leiothrix argentauris)  found dead on February 2, 2007, in a densely developed part of Mong Kok in Hong  Kong, have been found to be positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza  (HPAI) H5N1.  Examination of vendor stalls in the nearby Bird Garden by  the Hong Kong Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) did not  detect any unusual mortality or illness in the birds for sale there. This is  the first time that the silver-eared mesia has been shown to be susceptible to  HPAI H5N1, but the species was part of a shipment of birds from Taiwan that was  in the quarantine facility outside London, UK, where H5N1 was detected in 2005.   Fifty-three of 101 mesias died in the quarantine facility along with two  blue-headed pionus parrots (Pionus menstruus) from Surinam at the time.   The origin of the H5N1 virus into the quarantine facility was never  conclusively identified.
