H5N1 has been identified in an Oriental magpie robin found dead at the Yen Po Street Bird Market in Mongkok. In response to the robinâ€™s death, all the birds in the stall where the robin was found have been culled, and the market, which has almost 70 stalls, will close for three weeks.  The remaining birds and workers at the marketplace are now under medical surveillance.
