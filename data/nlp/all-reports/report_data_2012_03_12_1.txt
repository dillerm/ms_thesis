H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
A black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) was found dead on March 2 at Tuen Mun and a peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus calidus) was found dead on March 3 at Ma On Shan. Samples from the birds were tested at the Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory and the Centre of Influenza Research. They were positive for H5N1 bird flu. An intensive surveillance system is already in place for all poultry farms, poultry markets, and pet bird shops in Hong Kong and surveillance and monitoring of local chicken farms has been stepped up. The source of the outbreak in wild birds is unknown and so far samples from poultry farms in Hong Kong have tested negative for H5 bird flu. Preventative measures such as stamping out, quarantine, movement control, screening, zoning, disinfection of premises, and dipping/spraying have been undertaken.
