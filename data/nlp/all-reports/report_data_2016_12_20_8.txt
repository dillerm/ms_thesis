France (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports 7 new poultry-farm outbreaks of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza in France (bringing the total number of such outbreaks this season up to 18).  The outbreaks occurred between December 7 and 10, in the Departments of Gers, Lot-et-Garonne, Pyrénées-Atlantiques, and Aveyron, in southern France.  Five of the outbreaks occurred on commercial duck and chicken farms, and were discovered by investigating epidemiological links and/or sampling within the protection zones of previous outbreaks.  One additional commercial farm was tested following clinical suspicion, and the outbreak in Aveyron involved mortality in a backyard flock.  In all cases, all animals in the affected flocks have been destroyed.  A 3 km surveillance zone and a 1km protection zone have been established around the outbreaks; other control measures include screening, disinfection/disinfestation, traceability, surveillance within and outside containment and/or protection zone, zoning, and stamping out.  Vaccination is prohibited, and there has been no treatment of affected animals.
