USA (LPAI H5N8)
 In a follow-up memo regarding the April 22 H5 confirmation in a commercial Japanese quail layer flock in California, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) confirmed that the H5N8 virus was isolated.  Additional observation and testing will continue and a surveillance and outreach plan has been implemented within a 10 km Control Area in hopes to prevent the disease from spreading.
