Cambodian health officials confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 in the capital city of Phnom Penh. Of the 200 susceptible birds, 83 died after becoming infected with the virus while the remaining 117 were destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading. The farm, where chickens were being raised for research at a nearby institute, has been disinfected. Other control measures being applied include stamping out and movement control.
