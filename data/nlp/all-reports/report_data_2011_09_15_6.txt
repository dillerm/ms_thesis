H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
In the Chuadanga District of Bangladesh, two poultry farms experienced outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu. At least 22,045 chickens were culled and 8,500 eggs destroyed to prevent the spread of disease. After chickens were found dead, both farms sent samples for testing to the Central Diseases Investigation Laboratory in Dhaka for analysis and received confirmation of H5N1 infection. Both farms will remain under observation for three months, and the trade of chickens has been banned within one and half kilometers of each infected farm. In addition, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza was observed in the Naogaon District of Bangladesh. Late in August, chickens tested positive for H5N1 bird flu at the Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute. Out of a total of 1,800 chickens, 500 died and 1,300 were culled to prevent the spread of disease.
