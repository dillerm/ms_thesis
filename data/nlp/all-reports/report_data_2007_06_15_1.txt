H5N1 in Wild Birds in Hong Kong.
A common magpie (Pica pica) found dead on  May 31 in Sha Tin in the New Territories in Hong Kong was confirmed with H5N1  this week by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department. This is  the 17th bird found positive for bird flu this year. A house crow (Corvus splendens) found dead on June 11 in Sham Shi Po tested positive for H5  avian influenza in preliminary tests; further characterizations are in  progress. A number of H5N1-infected wild birds including munia, blue magpie and  a house crow were found dead on Jan 16 and are believed to have been released  as part of religious rituals. These birds were previously reported from Sham  Shui Po.
