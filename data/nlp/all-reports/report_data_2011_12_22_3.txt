H5N1 in Poultry in Hong Kong
 After a chicken that died at a wholesale poultry market in Long Sha, Kowloon tested positive for H5N1 bird flu, the remaining 17,000 chickens at the market were culled to prevent the spread of the disease.  Additionally, the Hong Kong government suspended the imports of live chickens from mainland China as well as the trading of live chickens for 21 days to further prohibit the spread of the virus.  A government spokesman said it is unknown if the dead chicken was a local chicken or imported from China, adding that the market would be emptied of birds and disinfected.  The last two large poultry culling exercises in Hong Kong took place in June 2008.
