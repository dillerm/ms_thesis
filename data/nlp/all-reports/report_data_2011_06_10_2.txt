H5N1 in Poultry in Pakistan
Contrary to the recommendations of the steering committee for bird flu, the Government of Pakistan reported on June 7 that it has decided to end the National Programme for the Control and Prevention of Avian Influenza (NPCPAI). NPCPAI had been in charge of prevention and control of bird flu in Pakistan. Based on measures taken under the program, the OIE had declared Pakistan free of bird flu for a period of three months. The program was dismissed through a notification issued by the Adviser to Prime Minister on Dev. Budget Muhammad Asif Shaikh. Some are concerned that due to this decision, Pakistan will not be able to prevent and control the bird flu, will undergo financial and health problems, and the OIE will eventually will not uphold the declaration that Pakistan is a bird flu free country.
