Canada (H5N1)
 On January 7, Canadian health officials confirmed North America’s first and fatal case of H5N1.  The victim, whose age and gender have not yet been released, was an Alberta resident who had recently returned from a month’s visit to China.  The person began showing flu-like symptoms on December 27 on a flight from Beijing to Vancouver.  The person then continued on to Edmonton on a connecting flight and was admitted to the hospital on January 1 and died on January 3. Federal Health Minister Rona Ambrose did report that the victim “was a relatively young person with no underlying health conditions, and, who unlike other avian flu fatalities, did not have contact with chickens on a farm or in an open market.”  He went on to remind people that the risk of contracting the disease is “very low” and that it is not a disease that is transmitted between humans.  The two people traveling with the victim are being closely monitored for 10 days to guarantee that they do not show any flu-like symptoms.  Additionally, the passengers on the flights have been notified of the incident. B.C.'s provincial health officer, Dr. Perry Kendall, said that "It was only a matter of time, given global travel patterns, before we saw cases in North America.”  Officials are confident that this is an isolated incident and are working with China in hopes to determine how and where the victim was exposed to H5N1.
