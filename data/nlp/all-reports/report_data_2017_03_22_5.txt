Nepal (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza among layer chickens in the Sunsari district of southeastern Nepal.  The outbreak began on 1 March; 3,650 layers died and 2,550 were destroyed.  26 local hens were also destroyed.  Control measures include movement control inside the country, screening, disinfection/disinfestation, quarantine, surveillance within and outside containment and/or protection zone, stamping out, and official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste.  The source of the outbreak is unknown.  This is the same district which experienced an outbreak of HPAI H5N1 among birds at a park, which occurred over about two weeks prior to 6 March, when it was confirmed (see previous section).
