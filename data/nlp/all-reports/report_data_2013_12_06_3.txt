H7N9 (Hong Kong)
Hong Kong health officials confirmed the territoryâ€™s first two human cases of H7N9. The first victim, a 36-year-old Indonesian woman, fell ill four days after purchasing, slaughtering, and eating a chicken from a live-bird market in Shenzhen. The woman visited a private doctor on November 25 and is currently in critical condition. The second victim, an 80-year-old man, was taken to the hospital on December 3, the same day he and his family arrived in Hong Kong from Shenzhen. He is in stable condition and is being treated in an isolation ward. It is unknown where the man came in contact with poultry, but officials believe it was not in Hong Kong. Close contacts with the woman and the man have been screened and none have tested positive for H7N9. Due to the recent outbreak, the Hong Kong Government has increased the response level of its pandemic flu preparedness plan, toughened their infection control measures, and has halted the sales of chicken from Shenzhen. Additionally, health officials are conducting border health checks to prevent the disease from entering the city. In other parts of China, Shanghai announced they will freeze all live poultry trading from January 31, the first day of the Chinese Lunar New Year, to April 30. This past year, 43 people in Shanghai died of H7N9 in April alone; and because experts have warned about the possibility of H7N9 reoccurring, officials are hoping that the sales ban will prevent any new outbreaks in 2014.
