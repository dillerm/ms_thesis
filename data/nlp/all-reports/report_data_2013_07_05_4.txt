Canada (H7).
The Public Health Agency of Canada reported that an American man at an Edmonton hospital tested positive for H7 bird flu virus. According to Canada's acting chief public health officer, the man is not currently ill from the flu and is not contagious. Dr. Gregory Taylor says that the event is a reminder that viruses like the new H7N9 bird flu are only a plane ride away. The blood test that was used to diagnose the previous infection could not determine the neuraminadase (N) component of the virus, but the specialist who treated him in Edmonton was on the lookout for H7N9 bird flu. In China, 132 people have been infected by H7N9 bird flu this spring and at least 39 have died from the disease. The patient had travelled to China in late May, though not a part of the country that has any recorded infections with H7N9 flu. He had also travelled to Singapore and India in recent weeks. The patient first became ill in India and spent time in an intensive care unit there, though it is not known what illness led to this hospitalization. After being released from the hospital in India, he travelled to the United Arab Emirates and boarded a flight to San Francisco. He became ill on the plane and lost consciousness, perhaps from a diabetic coma. The flight was diverted to Edmonton where quarantine officers determined that his symptoms did not indicate active influenza. Once he was in the hospital in Edmonton, he developed pneumonia and doctors ordered a battery of tests. These tests were negative for active viral infection, but turned up evidence of a past infection with H7 flu. The Canadian Public Health Agency has sent samples from the man to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, which has not been able to confirm the presence of the antibody to H7 influenza. The case is now listed as a “suspect positive” according to the Canadian Public Health Agency as both organizations investigate this case further.
