H5N1 in Poultry in Romania
Romaniaâ€™s national laboratory confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu on a backyard poultry farm in Letea, on the Danube delta. Romania undertook the measures specified under European Union legislation to prevent the spread of the disease, including culling the poultry on the infected farm, establishing a protection zone within a 3 km radius, establishing a surveillance zone within a 10 km radius, banning the gathering of poultry, and strengthening biosecurity measures. This is the first outbreak of bird flu in the European Union in over a year.
