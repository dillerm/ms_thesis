Avian Influenza in Humans in Cambodia (HPAI H5N1).
Cambodian health officials confirmed three new human cases of H5N1. Two of the victims, a 3-year-old boy from Phom Penh and an 11-year-old boy from the Kampong Chhnang province, died after contracting the virus. The third victim, an 8-year-old boy from Kandal province is currently in stable condition. To date, there have been 8 outbreaks of H5N1 in Cambodia this year, three resulting in the death of a child. Officials are urging parents and guardians to keep their children away from sick and dead poultry and to wash their hands often as they are highly susceptible to the disease.
