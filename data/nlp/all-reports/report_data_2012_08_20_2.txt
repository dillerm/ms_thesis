H7N7 in Poultry in Netherlands
 Earlier this month, an outbreak of H7N7 low pathogenic avian influenza occurred on a farm in the Utrecht province.  After free range laying hens tested positive for the virus at the Central Veterinary Institute in Lelystad, the entire flock (a total of 31,870 hens), was culled to prohibit the spread of the virus.  The source of the outbreaks remains inconclusive and there are no other commercial poultry holdings in the 1km zone surrounding the affected area.  To help reduce the risk of more outbreaks, zoning, disinfection, and movement control of poultry have been applied.
