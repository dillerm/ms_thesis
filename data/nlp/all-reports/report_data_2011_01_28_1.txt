H5N1 in Wild birds
Ecologists and epidemiologists have been concerned about the role of migratory animals in the spread of disease particularly the possibility that migrating flocks of birds carry H5N1 bird flu into new areas and spread to humans. It has generally been thought that migration would increase the risk of disease spread, but a recent review paper suggests that migrating animals may actually help to keep highly pathogenic diseases in check. Birds that migrate across continents tend to have a higher viral load than those that stay at home year round, but for some birds migration might help to avoid the more virulent pathogens that can accumulate in one environment. Furthermore some sick animals are not able to travel as far as healthy ones, which can reduce the spread of infections. For instance, a 2007 study showed that Bewick's swans (Cygnus columbianus bewickii) infected with strains of avian flu viruses migrated later in the season and traveled shorter distances than healthier birds. By understanding these disease dynamics, researchers will be better able to suggest methods for reducing potential pandemics. However, human activities have affected migration patterns; less available land and more impediments to movement, such as fragmented habitat, cause more animals to end up in a few crowded stopovers like Delaware Bay or end their migration early, leaving fewer opportunities to escape local infection or leave the sick behind. Climate change has already changed caused migration routes to shift into new areas and seasons, likely changing the pathogens that affect migrating animals.
