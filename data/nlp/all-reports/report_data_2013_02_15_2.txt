H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
 The World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed two new cases of H5N1 in Cambodia, bringing the number of human deaths to seven since the start of the year.  The most recent victims, a three-year-old girl and a five-year-old girl, from the southern provinces of Kampot and Takeo respectively, both died after contracting the deadly virus.The Ministry of Health issued a statement earlier this week expressing concern that “although the virus does not easily spread among humans, if the virus changes, it could easily be spread like seasonal influenza.”  To prevent such a pandemic and to hopefully prevent the virus from spreading, the Ministry of Health is testing villagers from recently infected communities and training additional staff in all public and private health facilities in at-risk provinces to ensure no new human cases are missed.  Additionally, the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization is working with animal health officials throughout the country in an attempt to start diagnosing bird flu in poultry before it is spread to humans.
