Hong Kong (HPAI H5N6)
The Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) in Hong Kong report a new case of highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus found in a great egret in Diamond Hill, Wong Tai Sin District. The bird, found dead in a non-public area of a popular park, was confirmed to be infected with H5N6 avian influenza by the Tai Lung Veterinary Laboratory. The immediate area was cleaned and disinfected, and monitoring of wild birds will continue to take place. There are no poultry farms within 3 miles of where the great egret was found, but the AFCD has reminded farmers and pet shop owners to take proper biosecurity precautions. The source of this outbreak is unknown.
