Of the 9,170 birds, 20 were tested.  No unusual mortality were reported to date and none of the birds were destroyed. Other measures were applied, including quarantining, movement control, screening, zoning, disinfection, and the prohibition of vaccinations or treatment of affected animals. The source of the outbreak has yet to be determined.
