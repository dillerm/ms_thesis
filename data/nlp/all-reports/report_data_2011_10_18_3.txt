H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
 On the island of Bali in Indonesia, two siblings died from H5N1 bird flu on October 9 at Sanglah General Hospital in Denpasar just two days after being admitted to the hospital.  The 10-year-old brother and 5-year-old sister were treated at a local health clinic before they were sent to the hospital. The family operates a catering service out of the home including the slaughtering and processing of chickens and both children were reported to have had contact with dead chickens before developing bird flu symptoms.  Bali Health Official, Nyoman Sutedja, claims the family failed to report the children’s bird flu symptoms in a timely manner, worsening the children’s condition, since Tamiflu, the medication used to treat bird flu, is only effective within the first 24 hours of infection. The source of the infection remains unknown, but the head of the Bali Animal Husbandry Office encouraged districts to enhance surveillance and spraying operations to help prohibit the spread of the virus.Separately, the World Health Organization confirmed H5N1 infection in a 1-year-old girl from the Jakarta Province of Indonesia who died on August 25. After developing symptoms of bird flu, the infant was treated at a health care facility on August 8 and eventually admitted to a private hospital on August 15. Possible sources of infection include a family member that worked with poultry products, including slaughtering, as well as poultry in the neighborhood of the victim, although there were no deaths of chickens reported within the last 14 days. Out of 179 total cases of bird flu infection in humans, 147 have been fatal.
