H5N1 in Wild birds in India
Wardens at the Szukhna Wildlife Sanctuary near the city of Chandigarth are watching for signs of bird flu in over 15,000 migratory birds wintering in the area. The forest guards conduct visual surveys four or five times a day at sites where the birds (many from Afghanistan, China, Central Asia and Siberia) congregate. "If we find any case, we will isolate and inoculate the bird. We are following all disease control measures. Our officials also try their best to keep the whole area clean and to prevent any littering," says the chief wildlife warden of Chandigarth.
