Hong Kong (LPAI H7N9)
Hong Kong's food and health authority confirmed this week the presence of H7N9 in a consignment of silkie chickens from Guangdong, China at the Cheung Sha Wan Temproary Market. Live poultry are held at the Temporaray Market pending the outcome of laboratory testing. Because of the positive results, the entire 20,000 poultry in the market at the time were culled Tuesday morning. Furthermore, the government is suspending poultry import from the mainland and live poultry sales on local markets for a minimum of three weeks. Monitoring of the mainland chicken farms will continue after the three weeks of suspension of live poultry trading.
