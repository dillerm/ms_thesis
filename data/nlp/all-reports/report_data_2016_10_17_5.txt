Laos (HPAI H5N1)
The Director General of the Department of Livestock and Fisheries reports a new case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus in Luang Prabang Province. A total of 47 birds died of the disease, and the remaining 103 were culled to prevent it spreading further. Additional control measures include: movement control; disinfection and disinfestation; dipping and spraying; quarantine; surveillance; and modified stamping out. The cause of this outbreak is unknown. Laotian officials consider this outbreak to be a new introduction, as the country was declared free of H5N1 in 2015.
