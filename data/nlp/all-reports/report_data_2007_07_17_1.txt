H5N1 in Wild Birds
Germany and the Czech Republic found that H5N1 viruses in both countries are  highly related.  Analysis of the recently isolated H5N1 sequences showed  that they probably have a common origin, but the viruses are different from the  H5N1 viruses isolated from outbreaks in Hungary and the United Kingdom at the  beginning of the year. Instead, the Euro-surveillance report concluded that  “the current virus is more closely related to a lineage originating from the  Middle East (including Bangladesh, Pakistan and Azerbaijan) and Russia.”
