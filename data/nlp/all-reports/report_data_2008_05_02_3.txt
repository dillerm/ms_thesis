H5N1 in Poultry in Denmark
Routine testing at a farm with 2,050 geese and ducks in the island of Fyn in Denmark has detected the presence of a strain of avian influenza. H5N1 has been ruled out and an LPAI H7 avian influena virus was detected. The strain was identified as H7N1, according to the Danish veterinary authority. None of the birds exhibited signs of disease, but all 300 geese, 250 ducks and 1,500 “wild” mallards will be destroyed. The main purpose of the farm is to restock birds for hunting purposes.
