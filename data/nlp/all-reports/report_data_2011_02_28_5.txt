H5N1 in Humans in Cambodia
Provincial authorities in Banteay Meanchey fear an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu after a mother and child died from Takong village, Malay District and 7 other people were hospitalized in mid-February. Samples taken from the 19-year-old mother who died on February 12, and her 11-month-old son, who died on February 15, were sent to the World Health Organization for testing and H5N1 has been confirmed. The mother had traveled in a family group to Rokar Chor village, Prash Sdach district in Prey Veng province in early January. Keo Sopheaktra, director of Banteay Meanchey province’s health department, said the mother and son became sick after eating infected chicken. “They both had a fever, cough and difficulty breathing before they passed away.” He said seven villagers who helped clean the bodies for cremation were admitted to the Mongkol Borei district hospital after each developed a fever and cough. The Director of the Mongkol Borei district hospital, Ho Serey Vitthyu, said the seven are responding well to treatment.
