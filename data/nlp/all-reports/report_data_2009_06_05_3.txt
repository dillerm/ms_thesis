H5N1 in Human in Egypt
A 14-month-old girl from the Dikirnis district has been confirmed positive with H5N1 bird flu. She came into contact with sick and dead poultry in the village of Daqahliyah. The girl has been hospitalized, treated with Tamiflu, and is being moved to Manshiyat Al-Bakri Hospital in Cairo for further treatment. A four-year-old girl from the Kefr El Sheikh district has also been confirmed positive for bird flu. She came down with symptoms May 30 and was hospitalized at Kefr El Sheikh Fever Hospital on May 31. They have treated her with oseltamivir and she is in stable condition. Investigations revealed that she had been in close contact with sick and dead poultry. These are the 77th and 78th cases of bird flu in Egypt since the first outbreak of the disease. According to the World Health Organization, scientists have used bird flu virus samples from Egypt to develop the basis for a new vaccine against the highly pathogenic strain of H5N1. Avian influenza kills about half of infected people, but does not spread easily between humans. The candidate virus was developed at the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta and the recombinant vaccine virus is available for distribution. Institutions and companies wishing to work on vaccine development should contact the WHO Global Influenza Program or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
