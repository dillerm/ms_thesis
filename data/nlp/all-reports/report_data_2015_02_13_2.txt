USA (HPAI H5N2)
A Cooper's hawk in Whatcom County and a red-tailed hawk in Skagit County, Washington tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza, the first confirmed cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in wild raptors in North America. The hawks died of other causes, but the findings are a cause for concern due to small population sizes.  It?s unknown how the hawks contracted the virus, as waterfowl, which carry the virus, are not a regular part of their diet.  The raptors were among the hundreds of wild birds that have been sampled to determine how widespread the virus is; results from the sampling will be used to create a surveillance plan.  Meanwhile, poultry owners are being urged to keep their birds from coming into contact with wild birds to prevent the virus from spreading to commercial poultry.
