Avian Influenza in Wild Animals in Japan (HPAI H5N8)
Japanese authorities confirmed that the highly pathogenic avian influenza type H5N8 was discovered in the Tottori Prefecture in Japan from duck fecal samples taken on November 18. Japan's Ministry of the Environment has established a 10-kilometer monitoring zone to prevent spread of the diseases. The Ministry is also investigating to determine if there are any dead or diseased birds affected by the virus. Experts think the source of the virus could be birds migrating from South Korea, where a similar outbreak occurred earlier this year. In the past few weeks, the same strain was found in wild bird droppings in the prefectures of Shimane and Chiba. No infections of poultry have been detected in any of the three prefectures. The Ministry has also announced that the virus was detected in a White-naped crane at a nature preserve in Izumi City in Kagoshima Prefecture. The 245 hectare preserve hosts the overwintering of more than 10,000 (80% of the world population) Hooded and White-naped cranes. Both species are listed as Vulnerable. Available information did not indicate whether the crane was healthy or had died at the time of sampling.
