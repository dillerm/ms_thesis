Avian Influenza in Poultry (H5N8) in Korea
According to Daegu Metropolitan Government (DMG), the H5N8 virus was found in three chickens that recently died at a poultry farm in Okcheon.  Since late last month, 100 chickens and 94 geese have died on the farm.  All the surviving birds ? 13 geese and 388 chickens ? at the farm were culled. The farm apparently bought 107 baby geese from a farm in Hongseong on June 14. Authorities in Daegu are stepping up efforts to contain the disease by setting up checkpoints to disinfect vehicles and prohibiting poultry from being transported within three kilometers from where the outbreak was reported.
