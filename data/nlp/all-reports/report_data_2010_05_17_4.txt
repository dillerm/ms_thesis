H5N1 in Poultry in West Bank
Several Palestinian media have reported that bird flu has been detected in the town of Bal’a near Tulkarm in the area of the West Bank under the control of the Palestinian Authorities. Bal’a is a major supplier of eggs and poultry products to the West bank and the poutry industry accounts for 40% of the local economy. Over 750,000 chickens have been ordered to be slaughtered in an effort to control the outbreak.
