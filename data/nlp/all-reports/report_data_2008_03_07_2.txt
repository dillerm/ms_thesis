H5N1 in Wild birds in UK
A Canada goose found dead on Feb. 25, 1 km from the Abbottsbury Swannery, tested positive for H5N1. It is the 11th bird found positive for H5N1 in this area. Locals had hoped that the Wild Bird Monitoring Area restriction zone would be lifted, but the finding of the new case on the final day of the restriction period will lead to a new 31-day quarantine period. The Swannery had hoped to reopen to the public on March 15 in time for Easter, traditionally one of their busiest periods. Under the Wild Bird Monitoring Area restriction, poultry has to be kept indoors or housed to prevent contact with wild birds.
