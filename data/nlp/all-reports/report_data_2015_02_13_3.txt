Canada (HPAI H5N1)
An outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus was confirmed at a noncommercial chicken layer farm in Chilliwack.  84 birds died, and the remaining 13 were destroyed.  The Canadian Food Inspection Agency has placed the farm under quarantine and set up a 1 km surveillance zone.  Partial gene sequencing suggest that the virus is the same or similar to the H5N1 virus previously found in adjacent Washington State in a green-winged teal, but more testing is need to confirm. This marks the first case of the strain in British Columbia.
