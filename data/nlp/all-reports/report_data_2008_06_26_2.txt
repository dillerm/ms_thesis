H5N1 in Poultry in Hong Kong
In an effort to stem the recent outbreak of avian influenza H5N1, Hong Kong has passed a measure to cull all live poultry at the close of wet markets.  The measure, which will go into effect on July 2nd, prohibits the sale of live chickens between 8 p.m. and 5 a.m., requiring farmers to cull their chickens at the end of each market day as a protective measure against the spread of bird flu.  The government has so far been unable to trace an early June outbreak of H5N1 at the wet markets, and has already established some safety measures such as a ban from obtaining chickens from mainland China.  However, farmers with booths at the wet market have threatened to release their live chickens as a protest to the governmental compensation offer to give up their stall licenses. The farmers fear the measure might open the door to a full prohibition of selling live poultry in Hong Kong.
