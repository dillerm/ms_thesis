Iraq (unspecificd bird flu-likely to be HPAI H5N1)
The Governor of Wasit, Iraq, Malik Khalaf Elwadi, announced today on 7/10/16 that entry of live chickens and eggs was banned to the province because of the spread of bird flu among people in the areas south of Baghdad. The ban was imposed after the governor received information and reports indicating the exposure of a number of citizens in the areas south of Baghdad, including the Al Madaen, and Al Wehdah neighborhoods. Local media sources are reporting outbreaks in adjacent Wasit province. A statement from the ministry of Agriculture as well as the Ministry of Health may be forthcoming to clarify the situation since so few details were provided.
