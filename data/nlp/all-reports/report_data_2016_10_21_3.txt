Laos (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports a case of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus on a farm in LuangPrabang Province. A total of 47 chickens died of the disease, and the remaining 83 chickens and 20 ducks were culled to prevent further spread. Additional control measures include: quarantine; movement control; disinfection and disinfestation; surveillance; dipping and spraying; and modified stamping out. The cause of this outbreak is unknown. The outbreak is considered to be a new introduction, as Laos had declared itself free of HPAI H5N1 in 2015.
