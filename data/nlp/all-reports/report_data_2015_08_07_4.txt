Mexico (H5)
An additional outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus has been reported at a poultry farm in Rosario, Sinaloa state.  To prevent the virus from spreading, 500,000 birds were culled and the affected premises have been placed under quarantine and surveillance.  It is believed the virus was spread through the movement of infected cardboard and crates from the ownerâ€™s other facility in Jalisco.
