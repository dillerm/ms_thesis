H5N1 in Wild birds in India
A large number of crows have died in cities and towns across the state of Jharkand since mid-November. The cause of death is unknown, but officials are asking people not to touch or bury the dead birds since they may be carrying a contagious avian virus. An advisory suggests that people should inform the Jharkand Animal Husbandry Department if they see dead birds. “The advisory has been issued considering the deaths of crows in many districts. Expert teams are trying to ascertain the reason behind the deaths of the crows,” animal husbandary department director A.G. Bandhopadhya told reporters.” The team of experts comes from the Indian Veterinary Research Institute of Bhopal. Health Department officials suspect that the birds are infected with H5 and H1 strains of bird flu.
