China (LPAI H7N9).
The article Novel Avian Influenza A(H7N9) Virus in Tree Sparrow, Shanghai, China, 2013 published recently in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases, found “high similarity” in the genetics of an avian influenza A(H7N9) virus from an apparently healthy tree sparrow in Shanghai and the H7N9 viruses from humans and poultry in the region. The authors suggest that there may be transmission from poultry to tree sparrows or vice versa and highlights the importance of tracking the influenza virus in a variety of species.
