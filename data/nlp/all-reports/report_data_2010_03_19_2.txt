H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
The District Livestock Service Office (DLO) of Nawalparasi announced on March 17 that bird flu has been detected in several Village Development Committees. The district has been declared an emergency zone. After ducks and chickens in the district began to die, the DLO sent samples to Britain for testing. It is reported that many birds have died recently and that residents are afraid that bird flu might spread rapidly because of the improper disposal of dead birds.
