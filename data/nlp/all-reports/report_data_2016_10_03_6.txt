China (H5N1 & H7N9)
A study was conducted to understand the risks of H7N9 and H5N1 virus infections in Northern China by surveying poultry workers, swine workers, and the general population in Beijing, China. The study issued and evaluated three surveys in November 2013, April 2014, and April 2015. The surveys showed that in comparison to the general population, poultry workers were at higher risk of contracting both H7N9 and H5N1. The outcome of the study suggest that while risk of H7N9 and H5N1 infections are low in Beijing, continued preventative measures are still warranted for poultry workers, because exposure to live poultry is the most significant risk for infection.
