Cambodia (HPAI H5N1)
Kratie Provincial Health Department confirmed that two siblings, ages 3 and 7,died from avian influenza. H5N1 has been confirmed in the 7-year-old but no samples were collected from the younger child. The apparent cause of exposure was a dead chicken that the parents found in the village and then cooked for dinner. Provincial officials were dispatched to the village to educate them not to touch or eat ill animals. The village had previously suffered an outbreak of avian influenza that killed 350 chickens in January.
