Avian Influenza in Poultry in North Korea (HPAI H5N1).
North Korean Health officials reported on April 9th that tens of thousands of poultry have either been culled or have died after contracting H5N1. The first outbreak was reported at a chicken farm in Pyongyang on March 21 and the virus has been spreading since. To prevent the disease from spreading further, an emergency quarantine commission has been created and an “emergency prevention situation” has been declared across the country. North Korea’s bird population suffered last year after being hit hard by the deadly flu virus. This is the country’s first outbreak of 2014.
