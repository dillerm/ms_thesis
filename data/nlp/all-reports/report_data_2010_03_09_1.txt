H1N1 in Hong Kong
The University of Hong Kong found that one sample taken during regular influenza virus surveillance was primarily a different swine flu strain but had picked up a gene from pandemic H1N1 (2009) by genetic reassortment. This is the first such sample found by the program. The government is monitoring developments, but urges people not to be alarmed as there is no health concern from cooked pork. Scientists are not surprised by this combination of viruses and it is likely that other similar combinations have occurred without being detected. Further tests are underway to determine the characteristics of the strain.
