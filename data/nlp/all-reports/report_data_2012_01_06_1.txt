H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong
 This past week, 2 dead black-headed gulls were found in Tuen Mun and Lantau Island of Hong Kong.  Both gulls tested positive for H5N1 bird flu.  There were no poultry farms within 3 kilometers of the carcasses and a recent survey of the 30 chicken farms in Hong Kong did not find any chickens that were infected with H5N1.  Hong Kong raised the bird flu alert to “serious” on December 21 after a dead chicken at a wholesale market tested positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza.  As a precaution, 15,569 chickens, 810 pigeons, 1,950 pheasants and 1,122 silky fowls were culled to prevent the spread of the disease, but tests now show none of the culled birds tested were infected with H5N1 bird flu.  The source of the dead chicken remains unknown.  The Hong Kong government is setting up a system for routine collection of dead birds at the wholesale poultry market for testing, and the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department will be on constant duty gathering information from poultry traders about dead birds.
