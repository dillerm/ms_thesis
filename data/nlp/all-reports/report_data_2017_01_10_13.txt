Iran (HPAI H5N8)
An outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza occurred at a farm in Quazvin Province, central Iran; 63,000 chickens and 800,000 fertilized eggs and day-old chicks have been culled to prevent its spread.  In addition, over 1,000 wild birds have been found dead of undetermined causes at Mighan wetland, about 250 km south of the farm.  Hunting licenses have been suspended as a precaution.  These events were reported on December 26.
