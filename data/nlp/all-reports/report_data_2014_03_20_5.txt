Avian Influenza in Poultry in Vietnam (HPAI H5N1).
Vietnamese health officials confirmed that a vaccine-resistant variant of H5N1 has been confirmed in the Mekong Delta province. Officials are worried because this year, the vaccine is showing signs of weakness compared to other years, resulting in the death of 1,000 ducks and the infection of chickens that had already been vaccinated. Authorities are worried that the number of avian influenza may increase over the next couple of months due to cold weather and have set up control teams to monitor and evaluate the virus.
