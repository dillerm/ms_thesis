HPAI H5N1.
A new study published in PNAS found that migratory birds in Asia transmit H5N1 avian influenza virus along flyways when they migrate.  Using satellite tracking data for four migratory bird species in Asia, highly pathogenic avian influenza  (HPAI) H5N1 virus outbreak records, and genome sequences of viral samples, the study shows a close association between the timing of bird migration and H5N1 outbreaks.  The study also shows that flyways are a major barrier to intracontinental spread of the virus as transmission then to spread along rather than acrosss flyways.
