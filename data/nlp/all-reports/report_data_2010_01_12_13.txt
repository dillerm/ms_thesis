A dog in New York is the first in the United States to be diagnosed with pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus. The 13-year-old mixed-breed male is thought to have caught the disease from its owner and is now recovering. The American Veterinary Medical Association said that there is still no evidence that the virus could be transferred from pets to humans. Dr. Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) said that it is rare for pets to spread flu viruses. Pigs on two farms in North Carolina have been diagnosed with pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus. Samples were tested and confirmed positive by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's National Veterinary Services Laboratory. The animals have fully recovered under the care of a private veterinarian. The pigs were tested after they showed signs of mild illness. State veterinarian, David Marshall, said, “These cases show that our surveillance system is working.” It appears that the animals on both farms caught the disease from humans. "We want to reassure the public that it is safe to eat pork from swine that have been infected previously and recovered from influenza viruses, including novel viruses," state health director Jeff Engel said. "As always, we will continue to work closely with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services to protect the health and safety of the public."
