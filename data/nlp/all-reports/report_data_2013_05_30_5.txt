H7N9 in Humans - Updates in China
 Researchers in China announced earlier this week that after analyzing blood samples collected from poultry workers in 2012, there is “no evidence to suggest mild or asymptomatic human infections” of the H7N9 virus occurring prior to the present outbreak.  Scientists from the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention tested poultry farmers who worked in eastern China, where the majority of this year’s H7N9 cases have been reported, including the city of Shanghai and the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Anhui.  The researchers concluded that “although no evidence of human H7N9 infection was found in the poultry workers before November 2012, it's possible that transmission from poultry to humans was occurring in other populations.”
