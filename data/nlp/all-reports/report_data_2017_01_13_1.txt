Global (H5N8)
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations warns of a potential highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5N8) virus pandemic in Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Middle East. The virus has been found in domestic and wild birds, but to date there are no known human cases. The FAO recommends increased surveillance and raising awareness in affected countries and those at risk. At this time, there is no justification for preemptive culling of wild birds or habitat destruction.
