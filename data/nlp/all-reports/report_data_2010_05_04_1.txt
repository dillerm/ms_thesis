H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
Outbreaks of H5N1 bird flu on 12 farms (11 commercial and 1 backyard) in Bangladesh were reported to the OIE on April 25. The report covers outbreaks between March 9 and April 16 in the Dhaka, Rajshahi, and Chittagong districts. Altogether the farms contained 141,276 poultry.  Over 78% were killed by the disease; the remaining birds were culled to prevent  disease spread. The source of the outbreak is unknown, but preventive measures such as movement control inside the country and disinfection of infected premises have been taken. Samples from the birds tested positive for H5N1 at the Bangladesh Livestock Research Institute, the Central Disease Investigation Laboratory, and the Field Disease Investigation Laboratory.
