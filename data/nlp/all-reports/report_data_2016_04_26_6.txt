Myanmar (HPAI H5, H9N2)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Sagaing Region Livestock Federation report a new case of highly pathogenic H5 and H9N2 avian influenza virus on poultry farms in Monywa.  About 35,000 chickens have been culled on 47 farms since April 3, when the birds began dying.  The diagnosis was confirmed by testing at the Monywa Diagnostic Laboratory, Mandalay Diagnostic Laboratory, and the Yangon Diagnostic Laboratory.  In addition to culling, control measures include movement control, disinfection, quarantine, surveillance, modified stamping out, and zoning.  The source of this outbreak is unknown, but poor farm biosecurity was noted in the area.
