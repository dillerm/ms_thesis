H5N1 in Poultry
Scientists from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) reported at the 240th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society on August 24 on a new study, in which mice learned to detect viruses in feces by smell. According to USDA scientist Bruce A. Kimball, "Based on our results, we believe dogs, as well as mice, could be trained to identify a variety of diseases and health conditions.‚Äù The researchers anticipate that their findings could lead to the use of trained disease-detector dogs to screen feces, soil, and other samples as an early-warning system for the emergence and spread of flu viruses. They also hope to identify the specific odor molecules that the mice sense and develop detection instruments for use in the field and in the laboratory.
