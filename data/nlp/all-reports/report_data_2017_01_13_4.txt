India (HPAI H5N1)
Highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has been found in two places in India. On January 2, an unreported number of backyard chickens were found dead in Kacharu village, Odisha state, in eastern India; a news release now confirms that samples from the dead chickens tested positive for highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza.  In December, several dead crows and other birds were found in the neighboring city of Rourkela: locals believe that they may also have been infected.  Officials began culling poultry in Karachu on January 8. Also on January 8, a news organization reported that HPAI H5N1 had been detected in two chicken samples from Kadaiya village in Daman district, western India.  Officials have declared the Daman district to be a ‘surveillance zone’ for the next 30 days (ending February 7), and they have prohibited the import, sale and storage of poultry products, and banned restaurants from serving chicken and egg products.
