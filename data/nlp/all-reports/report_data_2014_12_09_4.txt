Avian Influenza in Poultry in Canada (HPAI H5)
British Columbia's Ministry of Agriculture and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency reported that avian influenza H5 was found on two farms in the Fraser Valley, a turkey farm in Abbotsford and a broiler breeder in Chilliwack. Initial tests were conducted December 1, and further tests are being done to determine the exact strain of the virus. The two farms are about 8 kilometers apart and there are no obvious connections identified so far. Both reported sudden deaths of birds over the weekend. About half of the 11,000 turkeys at the Abbotsford operation have already died, as well as about 1,000 of the 7,000 chickens at the Chilliwack operation. The two farms are under quarantine and the remaining birds will be destroyed. Two other farms located between the two initial locations have been placed under quarantine because of a history of recent movements of equipment and materials from the affected farms. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency is establishing a surveillance zone for more testing, and surrounding farms are tightening movement controls.
