Israel (HPAI H5N1)
An outbreak of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus was reported in a flock of 10- week-old turkeys at a farm in the city of Acco in the northern district of Hazafon.  One thousand of the birds died and the remaining 12,000 birds were culled.  In addition to culling, the farm has been quarantined and movement control measures have been put in place. The virus in previous outbreaks of H5N1 in Israel and the Palestinian Territories were related to those in Egypt. The source of the outbreak is unknown and epidemiological investigation is still underway.
