Taiwan (HPAI H5N2)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has reported 2 new cases of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus on farms in Changhua County and Tainan City.  Samples were sent to the Animal Health Research Institute after abnormal mortalities were observed in native chickens and geese on the farms.  A total of 3,024 birds died from the virus, and the remaining 12,919 were culled to prevent it spreading further.  Additional control measures include movement control, screening, disinfection, quarantine, stamping out, and zoning.  Because both farms were closed to the outside, neither was prone to infection by wild birds.  Although the cause of the outbreak is unknown, officials believe the virus was brought in from the outside.
