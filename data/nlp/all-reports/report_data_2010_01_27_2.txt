H1N1 in animals in Japan
On January 12, a worker on a farm in Yamagata prefecture reported to the Livestock Hygiene Service Center that some of the pigs had symptoms such as poor appetite, fever, and cough. The farm holds 2,445 pigs, 164 of which were ill. They took samples from ten of the sick pigs and four of the samples tested positive for pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus at the National Institute of Animal Health. The farm is voluntarily restraining the movement of the animals to prevent the spread of the disease. Some workers had been sick before the outbreak, and an epidemiological investigation is underway.
