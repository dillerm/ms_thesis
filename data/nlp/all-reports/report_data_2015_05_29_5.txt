USA (HPAI H5N2)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE)'s Director General Bernard Vallat said that the avian influenza epidemic is likely to be under control within a few months as the United States has increased measures to contain the disease and the summer heat weakens it.  The virus has led to the death or culling of more than 40 million birds from commercial farms and backyard flocks in 16 states.  The epidemic was particularly severe in the U.S. because farmers were not prepared, and because of the large size of the nation's farms. Three additional cases of the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza have been confirmed in two commercial farms (one with 240,000 chickens) and one backyard flock in Sioux County, Iowa.  The state also reported two probable cases at farms in Adair County (975,000 birds) and Webster County (160,000 birds), bringing the total number of outbreaks in the state to 66.  Initial testing showed positive for H5 avian influenza, and additional testing is underway.  All affected premises have been quarantined and the surviving birds culled to prevent further spread of the virus. In Minnesota, six additional cases of the virus have been confirmed at three turkey farms in Kandiyohi County, two in Renville County, and one in Brown County.  A total of 94 cases have now been reported in the state, resulting in the death of over 8 million birds. The United States Department of Agriculture will be trapping small mammals and birds in Iowa and testing them for avian influenza.  Although there have been no confirmed cases of the virus in mammals, it is believed rodents may transmit the virus to chicken or turkeys by carrying infected material on its fur or paws.
