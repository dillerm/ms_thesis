France (LPAI H5N2)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) has confirmed two new cases of low pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus in ducks on two different farms in the Landes Department. As part of the national surveillance program, the National Reference Laboratory tested samples and confirmed the manifestation of the virus on December fourth. No birds have died or have been culled, but measures have been taken in the form of screening, disinfection, traceability, stamping out, and vaccine prohibition. The source of these outbreaks is unknown.
