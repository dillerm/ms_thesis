H5N1 in Humans in Indon√©sia
A 17-year-old boy suspected of having contracted the H5N1 bird flu virus is in critical condition at the Arifin Achmad regional public hospital in Pekanbaru, Riau. According to the head of bird flu control, Azisman Saad, the patient is receiving intensive care in an isolated room but is still in a coma-like condition with a high fever. A sample has been sent for testing to confirm H5N1. It is not known how the patient was infected, but he began to show symptoms on January 15. The hospital recently cured a 4-year-old girl who had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. She has fully recovered and has been moved from isolation to an ordinary ward for observation.
