H5N1 in Humans in USA (H3N2)
The Centers for Disease Control reported on January 15 that a boy from Iowa had contracted an H3N2 strain of swine flu that is different from both the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus and seasonal H3N2 strains. An investigation showed no evidence of person-to-person transfer so the strain is not likely to spread. The boy caught the strain in September, but was not tested until November. He did not need to be hospitalized and recovered fully on his own. â€œWhile these cases are rare, they're not unheard of," Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, said, "We do detect them from time to time and it's important for us to investigate, which happened in this case. And luckily there wasn't any evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission." It is not known how the boy contracted the virus.
