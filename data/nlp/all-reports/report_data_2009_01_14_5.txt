H5N1 in Poultry in India
H5N1 has been confirmed in the province of West Bengal. A District Magistrate in the village of Lorhata said that H5N1 has been detected in bird samples. Some reports claims as many as 5000 birds have died. Of the five affected villages in the area, over 2000 birds have died in Budhia-Kola alone. Bishon Choudhury said in late December, "Thousands of poultry birds died in Budhia, Budhia-Kola, Satgharia, Anandipur, Madhyapara and Nagrai."In addition to these five villages, outbreaks this week may have occurred in Siliguri, Darjeeling, Mathigarah and Pubang, where over a thousand chickens have died.  Results from samples are forthcoming, though bird flu has been confirmed in samples from Darjeeling, where poultry products have been banned in the tourist town to diminish the possible spreading of H5N1.Several outbreaks of bird flu were also found in Assam province in mid-December, affecting numerous crows and over 3,500 chickens.  The crows tested positive for H5N1, and were likely infected by the dead chickens.  The villages of Budhia, Kharguli, Sariha, and Kheluamara were affected by this outbreak.Last week new cases of bird flu were detected in 15 villages in Assam District where hundreds of backyard poultry died and over 24,000 were destroyed in an attempt to stem the spread of the virus.In India, a total of 19 epicenters of infection have been identified and the culling covers 150 villages in 8 districts and over half a million birds since Nov 27.
