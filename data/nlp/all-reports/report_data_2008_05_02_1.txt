H5N1 in Wild birds in Japan
Four wild swans, three of which are dead, have tested positive for H5 avian influenza near Lake Towada, a popular tourist destination, on the border of Aomori and Akita prefectures. They were found on April 21. Tests by the National Agriculture and Food Research Organization has determined that all four birds were positive for highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1. The species of the four swans was not provided in the official report to OIE, but are said to be whoopers (Cygnus cygnus) in local reports. There has been no large scale mortality of wild birds in the area and there are no poultry farms within 10 km. Japan has not had an H5N1 outbreak since March 2007, when a Hodgson’s hawk eagle (Spizaetus nipalensis orientais) tested positive in Kumamoto Prefecture, Kyushu Island.  The Environment Ministry said it plans to check between 20 to 100 ducks, geese, and wild swans at inspection stations in three prefectures--Akita, Aomori and Hokkaido--around lakes and rivers for H5N1.
