H5N1 in Wild birds in China
An outbreak of bird flu in migratory birds has been confirmed in Gonghe County, in Qinghai province in Central China. The outbreak began on May 5 and 200 wild birds had died near Gengghai Lake as of May 21. They tested positive for H5N1 at China’s National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory. There are 133 hectares of wetlands in the county and it is an important stopping point for migratory birds. As of May 19 there were still at least 1,000 birds visible in the county’s wetlands. Officials are taking precautions, such as disinfecting all area farms and banning outsiders from entering. Although no poultry have shown signs of bird flu, 21,000 have been culled and 23,000 have been vaccinated to prevent the spread of the disease.
