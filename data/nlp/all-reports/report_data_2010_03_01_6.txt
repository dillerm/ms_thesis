H5N1 in Humans in Vietnam
A 3-year-old girl from Khanh Hoa has tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. This is the first case in Vietnam in 2010. The girl became ill with a fever, sore throat, cough, and runny nose on January 27 and was admitted to Ninh Hoa hospital the next day. Bird flu was confirmed as the cause of illness on February 12 and the girl is reportedly recovering. An investigation near the girlâ€™s home found no signs of bird flu, but a month earlier, ostriches on a farm one kilometer away had died suddenly. The total number of human cases in Vietnam since the first outbreak of the disease is now 112.
