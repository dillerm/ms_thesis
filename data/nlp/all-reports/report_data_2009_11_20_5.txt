H5N1 in Poultry in France
Ducks on a farm in Saint Aubin du Plain tested positive for low pathogenicity H5 avian influenza on November 13. Poultry on the farm did not show clinical signs, but the disease was found through routine testing. All 9,000 ducks on the farm will be culled and the farm will be disinfected for 21 days to prevent the spread of the disease. An epidemiological investigation of nearby farms showed that the virus has not spread.
