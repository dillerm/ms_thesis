H5N1 in Poultry in Israel
 At the end of March, a 6-week-old turkey flock in the Zavdiel moshav was previously reported to be infected with highly pathogenic avian influenza.  Repeat testing of the initial samples were inconsistent for the H5N1 virus, additional testing on the birds was implemented.  These were all negative and suggest the turkeys were not infected with H5N1 bird flu.  The poultry showed no symptoms of infection, and there were no deaths related with this event. The turkeys were culled before subsequent testing proved they were not infected with H5N1 bird flu.
