H5N1 in Poultry in UK
A study from Liverpool University predicts that if bird flu was found on a farm in the UK, the spread of the virus would be limited to the single farm 73% of the time. In addition, the researchers found that the spread would be limited to only a small number of other sites the rest of the time because of safeguards already in place.
