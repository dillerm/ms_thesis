Norway.
There have been five recent outbreaks of pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus in Norway with one incident each in Rogaland, Akershus, Hedmark, and two in Nord-Trondelag. The first outbreak began on October 19 and the most recent began on October 24. Thirty pigs from 2,366 in the various herds have tested positive. The outbreaks were likely caused either by the transfer of infected animals to the herd or by contact with infected humans. Epidemiological investigations are being conducted to determine when the first signs of disease appeared in the pigs and when the first signs of illness appeared in the farm workers as well as to track the movement of pigs in and out of the farm. Molecular typing to confirm the strains is also being done to establish an epidemiological link between strains affecting pig herds and those affecting humans. A total of 27 farms have been affected since Oct 9.
