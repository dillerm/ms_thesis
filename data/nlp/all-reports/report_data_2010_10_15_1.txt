H5N1 in Wild birds
At Qinghai Lake in China, where more than 6,000 wild birds died in 2005, migrating birds are being tracked by satellite. This is one in a series of investigations that began after H5N1 bird flu first swept the region in 2005. The studies aim to pinpoint the viral reservoir and to determine the role that wild birds play in transmission. No reservoir has yet been found, but transmission routes have become more clear.
