France (HPAI H5N2)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports a new case of highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus at a poultry farm in the Department of Landes.  Samples were taken from a hatchery in Hinx as a part of previously implemented surveillance, and tested positive by the ANSES National Reference Laboratory for avian influenza and Newcastle disease.  The 2,200 susceptible birds will be culled in order to prevent further spread of the virus.  Further control measures include movement control, screening, disinfection, traceability, surveillance, zoning, stamping out, and official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste.  The source of this outbreak is unknown.
