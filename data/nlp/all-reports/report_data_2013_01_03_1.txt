H5N1 in Poultry in Nepal
On January 2, a District Animal Health Office’s (DAHO) rapid response team culled 2,640 chickens at a poultry farm located in Sitapaila near Nepal’s capital city, Kathmandu, after receiving confirmation the night before that the birds were infected with H5N1 bird flu. This is the fourth farm to be affected in December and was located less than 500 meters from the first outbreak in Dharke. An additional 527 eggs and 25 kilograms of chicken feed were also destroyed to prevent the spread of the virus. The DAHO believes the source of this outbreak may have come from local farmers, who visited one of the other poultry farms in Kathmandu that suffered an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza last week. These farmers then returned to their farms and could have transmitted the virus to their own poultry. Surveillance of the affected area has increased, and the rapid response team deployed by the DAHO has disinfected the poultry farm. In the Nuwakot district of Nepal, an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza was reported this week. A sample of a dead chicken at a residence in the village of Chaughada was sent for testing after other local chickens began to die. The test for bird flu was positive, and a team was dispatched from the capital to cull any other infected birds in the area. The source of the virus is believed to be two broiler chickens imported from the capital, Kathmandu, where several outbreaks of bird flu have recently occurred. Schools in the affected area were closed for three days to prevent the spread of the virus through human contact with other birds.
