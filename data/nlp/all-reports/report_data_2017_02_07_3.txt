Northern Ireland (HPAI H5N8)
A news article dated 2 February reported the first confirmed case of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza in Northern Ireland.  A whooper swan was found dead on Lough Beg in County Londonderry, and reported by the public to an avian influenza surveillance program.  Testing of the swan confirmed the presence of the virus.  This is the first time that that virus was found in Northern Ireland. Poultry farmers are required to keep their animals indoors whenever possible, and to prevent contact with wild birds when indoor housing is not possible.
