Kazakhstan (HPAI H5N1)
A gannet found dead on the Shalyga Island in the Kazakhstan portion of the Caspian Sea has been confirmed to be infected with the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus.Â  It is unknown where the bird came, but officials are not concerned as it appears to be an isolated case. However, over 1200 seabirds, mainly gulls, have died of unknown causes in the last week of June on Shalyga Island and it is unknown if the two events are related.
