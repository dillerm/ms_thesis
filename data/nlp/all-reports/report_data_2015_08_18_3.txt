Nigeria (HPAI H5N1)
According to the National Veterinary Research Institute (NVRI), two additional cases of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus have been confirmed at poultry farms in Abia and Enugu states in the eastern part of the country.  This is the first time the virus has been reported in these states and the first case since May, bringing the total number of affected states to 20.  The source of the disease has been traced to the purchase of birds in Ibadan at the point of lay.  NVRI has suggested the establishment of a surveillance unit and is awaiting response from the federal government.
