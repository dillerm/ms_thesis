Vietnam (HPAI H5N1)
 Vietnamese officials reported on February 18 that 24 outbreaks of H5N1 have been confirmed in 11 provinces throughout Vietnam including Long An, Ca Mau, Khanh Hoa, Ba Ria- Vung Tau, Dak Lak, Kon Tum, Tay Ninh, Phu Yen, Nam Dinh, and Lao Cai.  To date, about 30,777 birds have been culled to prevent the disease from spreading further.  Additionally, Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (MARD) has banned all poultry sales both in and out of the country, is requesting that all live poultry markets be closed at least one day per month so the area can be sterilized, and is working on increasing peopleâ€™s awareness of the deadly virus.
