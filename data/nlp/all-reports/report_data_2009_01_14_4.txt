H5N1 in Poultry in China
Chickens tested positive for bird flu in Haian county and in Dontai city, both in Jiangsu province, in mid December, 2008. The Agriculture Ministry said that 377,000 chickens and other poultry had been culled. In the statement, the Ministry said that migratory birds may have been the source of the outbreak, but no additional details have been provided. This outbreak may have occurred as much as a month earlier than officially stated, allowing infected chickens to be sold around the country. Villagers said that about 70% of the chickens died in the region and allege that officials covered up this news because they had no plans for monitoring or regulating the sale of chickens. However, Wu Peiliang, the head of the provincial Agriculture and Forest Bureau said that the H5N1-positive samples had come from live chickens which did not show symptoms and the recent poultry deaths in Jiangsu province were from other causes.
