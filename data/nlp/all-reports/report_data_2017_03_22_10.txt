USA (LPAI H7N9)
The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) reports that low-pathogenic H7N9 avian influenza was found on 6 March during routine pre-slaughter testing of broiler chickens in Giles County, Tennessee, southeastern USA.  The birds did not show any external symptoms, but all 16,500 were destroyed as a precautionary measure. Other control measures include movement control inside the country, quarantine, surveillance within and outside containment and/or protection zone, stamping out, official disposal of carcasses, by-products and waste, zoning, and disinfection/disinfestation.  This is the first time H7N9 LPAI has been detected in commercial poultry in the United States this year, and the first time it has been detected in poultry in Tennessee.
