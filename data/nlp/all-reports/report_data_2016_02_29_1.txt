France (HPAI H5)
It has been reported that 2 new cases of highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza virus have appeared at duck farms in the Department of Dordogne in France.  A total of 8,000 ducks were scheduled to be culled on February 25 and 26 to prevent further spread of the disease.  This is the 2nd time avian influenza has hit one of the farms; in November 2015 it was thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. The cause of these outbreaks was not reported.
