H5N1 in Humans in Hong Kong
The Centre for Health Protection of the Department of Health reported a human case of H5N1 bird flu infection in a 2-year-old boy who lived in Guangzhou City in Guangdong province. The patient developed symptoms on May 23 and went to a private clinic in Hong Kong on May 26. While there, he developed febrile convulsion and was transferred to Princess Margaret Hospital on May 28. Laboratory tests confirmed H5N1 as the cause of illness on June 2. It is believed that he contracted the disease when his mother took him to a wet market with live poultry in mid-May where they bought a live duck and had it slaughtered. He had also traveled with his family to Anhui province on May 20-22, but had no contact there with poultry. Eighty close contacts have tested negative for bird flu. The patientâ€™s condition is serious and he is receiving isolated treatment at the hospital.
