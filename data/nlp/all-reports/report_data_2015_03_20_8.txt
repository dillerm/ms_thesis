Vietnam (HPAI H5N6)
An additional case of the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus has been reported on a farm in the Hai Tinh Gia district which houses 103 ducks and 190 chickens. Although not as well-spread as H5N8 and H5N2, the H5N6 strain causes particular concern because of its ability to infect humans.
