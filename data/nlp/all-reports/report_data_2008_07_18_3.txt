H5N1 in Humans in Indonesia
A 38 year old man from Banten Province is suspected of dying from H5N1. He was a cargo worker in Blendung village, 24 km west of Jakarta, and died on July 10th after developing symptoms on July 5th.  It is not clear how he became exposed to bird flu, as none of the poultry in the area where he lived has tested positive or has been culled. This case has not been officially recognized, but The Associated Press confirmed the report with an official of the national bird flu commission.  Two women died of bird flu at the end of May, and this additional death continues Indonesia's high mortality rate in humans, which now unofficially stands at 111. (more...)
