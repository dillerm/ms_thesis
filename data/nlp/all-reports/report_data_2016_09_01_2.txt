Togo (HPAI H5N1)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reported two cases of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza virus on poultry farms in the Maritime Region. In Adetikope, 10,350 birds died on a semi-modern farm without biosecurity, H5N1 was confirmed after samples were tested by the National Veterinary Laboratory.  The remaining 3000 birds were culled to prevent further spread of the disease. In Adidogome, 950 birds died on a farm with no biosecurity and the remaining 30 birds were destroyed. Additional control measures include movement control, disinfection and disinfestation, traceability, quarantine, surveillance, and official disposal of carcasses, by-products, and waste.  Other measures that are scheduled to be applied are screening, stamping out, and control of wildlife reservoirs.  The last time Togo was affected with HPAI H5N1 was in 2008. The cause of this outbreak is unknown, but the adjacent countries in western Africa have been battling H5N1 since 2015.
