Mexico (HPAI H7N3)
On April 4, 2017 it was reported that highly pathogenic H7N3 avian influenza has been detected on a commercial farm in Jalisco, Mexico. The virus was detected among 15,000 laying hens whom had been previously vaccinated. The farm is now quarantined and the birds will be culled. A similar outbreak was detected in the same facility in 2012. Discovery of the virus was aided by a surveillance program implemented after the 2012 detection.
