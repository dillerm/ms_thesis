India (HPAI H5N1)
The National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases confirmed on December 16 the presence of H5N1 among domestic geese at Sukhna Lake in the Union Territory of Chandigarh. Of 100 susceptible birds, 22 have died. Chandigarh authorities plan to carry out mass culling of the birds, as well as culling of birds within a one-kilometer radius of the lake, and may plan further measures. Boating on the lake has stopped, and people are advised not to swim in the lake. Sixteen forest and wildlife department personnel who were handling the sick and dead ducks over the past two weeks were sent to the hospital for screening.
