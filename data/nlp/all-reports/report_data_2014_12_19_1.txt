Scandinavia (LPAI H10N7)
The Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management announced on December 16 that about 3,000 harbor seals have died so far this year in Swedish and Danish waters, probably from infection with avian influenza virus H10N7. There have been additional reports of avian influenza-related seal deaths in Norway, Germany and the Netherlands. The virus was first detected in April off the coast of Gothenburg, Sweden, and in October estimates for number of seal deaths were 700. However, mortality estimates are difficult since most of the dead seal carcasses sank. There are about 10,000 seals in Sweden and 12,000 in Denmark. The agency thinks that most Swedish seals have probably been infected by the virus but that the majority developed protective antibodies.
