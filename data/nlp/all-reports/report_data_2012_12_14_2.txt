H5N1 in Poultry in Indonesia
According to the Indonesian Agriculture Ministry, a new, more dangerous type of bird flu strain has been discovered in Indonesia and has killed more than 300,000 ducks in Central, East and West Java since November. In a recent letter, the Agriculture Ministry?s veterinary chief Syukur Iwantoro explained that this new virus strain, with clade 2.3.2, is a different clade to what is usually found in Indonesia. All of the previous H5N1 outbreaks in Indonesia had been viruses from clade 2.1. While H5N1 viruses in Egypt tends to be clade 2.2, clade 2.3.2 viruses have previously been found in but not Indonesia. (A clade is a group of organisms with a common ancestor.) To prevent further outbreaks, Iwantoro is urging further research to be done to identify the origins of the virus. In the meantime, officials are monitoring all birds coming in and out of the country and are urging people to consume poultry with caution until more is known about this new, dangerous strain.
