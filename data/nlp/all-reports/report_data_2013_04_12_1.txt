H7N9 in Wild birds in China
 Chinese health officials announced that to help prevent further spread of the deadly H7N9 bird flu virus, scientists throughout China have increased the monitoring of bird migration paths.  This decision comes as birds in southern China have started migrating north as winter nears.  Bird experts from the Qinhuangdao Wildlife Conservation Center in the Hebei Province are collecting and testing bird feces on a daily basis in addition to warning local residents to stay away from any sick or dead birds and report any suspicious activity to authorities as soon as possible.University of Hong Kong microbiologist Professor Yuen Kwok-yung said in an interview in the journal Nature this week that he believes wild ducks and geese are already carrying the virus. 229 wild bird samples were collected from around Shanghai on April 2 and none were found to carry the H7N9 virus. This week, 100 parrots and doves being smuggled onto Taiwan were destroyed in hopes to prevent the virus from spreading from the mainland.
