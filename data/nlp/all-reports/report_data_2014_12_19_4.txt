Japan (HPAI H5N8)
The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries announced the first outbreak of avian influenza in the country since April. The H5N8 virus caused the death of more than 20 chickens on a farm in Kitagawa, Miyazaki prefecture, and authorities have culled about 4,000 birds and disinfected the farm. Shipments of poultry and eggs have been restricted within a 6-mile radius of the farm, and authorities are investigating the route of infection. The outbreak in April occurred in Kumamoto prefecture, and 112,000 chickens on two farms were destroyed.
