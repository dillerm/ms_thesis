H5N1 in Wild birds in Saudi Arabia
For the third year in a row, Saudi Arabia has banned the hunting of migratory birds. The Saudi Wildlife Authority (SWA) explained that although the country is free from bird-related viruses such as bird flu, they are taking this measure to ensure that no epidemics occur. SWA Secretary-General Bander bin Saud bin Mohammad was among the many government officials and scientists to attend the 10th Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals in Bergen, Norway. This conference discussed urgent conservation needs to address the rapid decline of migratory bird species around the world. The SWA has deployed several teams to track migratory birds during their stay in the region.
