China (H7N9)
Chinese Health officials reported earlier this week that a 51-year-old woman tested positive for the H7N9 virus. The woman, from the Guangdong province, was a poultry slaughtering worker in a local market for many years, and is in critical condition. None of the 36 people who have had close contact with the victim are showing flu-like symptoms. In hopes to prevent the disease from spreading, the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Department distributed five tons of disinfectant across the province. To date, 133 people in Mainland China have contracted the H7N9 virus, with 43 cases resulting in death.
