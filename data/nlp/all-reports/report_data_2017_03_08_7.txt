Authorities report an outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza (H5) at a chicken farm in the city of Nonsan in the South Chungcheong Province. Approximately 70,000 chickens were culled in response to the outbreak and authorities have disposed of eggs at 3 hatcheries and closed a feed factory and 2 fertilizer farms in the vicinity. Authorities are investigating the source of the outbreak, but the farm is near a reservoir where migratory birds gather as well as a meat processing plant. Control measures include quarantine measures, disinfection, and distribution of vaccines.
