Avian Influenza in Canines in South Korea (H5N8).
Korea's agriculture ministry reported an outbreak of H5N8 in the South Chungcheong province on March 14. Authorities confirmed that a farm dog became sick after eating infected chicken. This is the first avian influenza case in a mammal that Korea has seen to date. All of the chickens at the farm have been destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading. Further research on the effects of H5N8 strain virus in mammals will be valuable in the future.
