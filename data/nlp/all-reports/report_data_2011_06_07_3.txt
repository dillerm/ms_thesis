Taiwan (LPAI)
After the H7N3 outbreak was confirmed on April 7, epidemiological investigation and intensified surveillance were carried out on poultry farms within a 3-km-radius. Samples taken from a duck breeder tested positive for low pathogenic H7N3 bird flu on May 26. The farm houses 1,900 ducks; 20 have tested positive. Movement restriction was implemented on the farm immediately after the disease was detected. Clinical investigation on that farm showed that the breeders were healthy without abnormal mortality. Other prevention measures have been undertaken including screening, zoning, and disinfection of the infected premises.
