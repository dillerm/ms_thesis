South Korea (HPAI H5N6)
A wild swan found dead on December 11 has tested positive for highly-pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza.  The swan was fond in the city of Gyeongsan, in southeastern South Korea.  Poultry movement has been restricted within 10 km of the location where the swan was found, and officials are optimistic that the strain will not spread in this region.
