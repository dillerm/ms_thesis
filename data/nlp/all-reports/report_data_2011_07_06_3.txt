H5N1 in Poultry in Netherlands (LPAI H7N7)
According to Murco Mijnlieff, an agriculture ministry spokesman, "Bird flu has been discovered at a poultry farm with some 47,000 chickens in Creil, in the (central) Flevoland province." He added that authorities believed it was a low-pathogenic variety of H7, but more tests were being done with full results expected June 25. "The farm is being cleaned up and the chickens are being killed," as a result of the outbreak, Mijnlieff reported. The outbreak was discovered when the farmer noticed a high number of ill chickens and decreased egg production. Tests were confirmed bird flu. Three other farms in the area are being monitored and authorities have introduced a 3 km (1.8 mi) radius transport ban on poultry, eggs and poultry waste.
