Vietnam (HPAI H5N6)
The World Organisation for Animal Health Report (OIE) has reported an additional case of the highly pathogenic H5N6 avian influenza virus in a backyard flock in the Lao Cai Province.  A total of 800 birds died and 1,000 were culled out of 1,800 birds to prevent further spread of the virus. In addition to culling, the practices of stamping out, disinfection and surveillance were carried out.  The source of the outbreak is unknown. Lao Cai is located in northern Vietnam next to Lai Chau where H5N6 was detected last month.
