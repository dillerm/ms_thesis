USA (HPAI H5N1)
On April 2, the U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Department of Agriculture published the genetic analysis of a mixed-origin HPAI H5N1 avian influenza virus in the journal Genome Announcements.  This novel virus was discovered in a green-winged teal in Washington State that was sampled at the end of 2014. The virus was found to contain four genes from the Eurasian HPAI H5N8 and four genes from North American low pathogenic avian influenza from wild birds. Although also highly pathogenic in poultry, this H5N1 virus is different from the well-known Asian H5N1 HPAI virus that emerged in 1996.
