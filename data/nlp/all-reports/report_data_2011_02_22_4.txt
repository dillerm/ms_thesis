H5N1 in Poultry in India
The High Security Animal Disease Laboratory in Bhopal conducted tests and confirmed an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu at a state duck and poultry farm in Tripura on February 16. The farm housed 4,293 birds and 2,198 of those have already died from the disease.. The source of the outbreak is still unknown, but an epidemiological investigation is ongoing. All domestic birds within a 3-km radius are being culled and the owners are being compensated. An intensive surveillance campaign that includes closure of poultry markets, prohibition on the sale and transportation of poultry products in the infected zone, and disinfection of affected premises has been enacted within a 10-km radius of the farm. Poultry owners who follow this protocol will be allowed to restock.
