H5N1 in Poultry in South Africa
 OIE recently reported 50 new cases (from different outbreaks) of highly pathogenic H5N2 bird flu in the Oudtshoorn district in Western Cape Province. All are ostriches from commercial farms in the area. The cases tested positive on serology during routine surveillance, but tested negative on initial PCR tests and no virus could be found.  Infection was confirmed after several follow-up PCR tests.  At the time of the report, no clinical signs or mortalities had been seen. To control the spread of the virus, the cases have been quarantined and other susceptible birds are being screened for the virus; culling is planned as a further control measure.
