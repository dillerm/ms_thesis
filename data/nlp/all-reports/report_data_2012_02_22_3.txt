H5N1 in Poultry in India
Bird flu (H5N1) has resurfaced in Orissa province. On February 3, the Bhopal-based High Security Animal Diseases Laboratory (HSADL) confirmed bird flu among the poultry population (28,851 birds) of Central Poultry Development Organisation (CPDO). The state government has restricted the movement of poultry within a 3-km radius of the CDPO. After the test results were announced, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation (BMC) called an emergency meeting and ordered the closing of poultry and poultry product shops in 21 wards within the alert zone. The BMC has sent around 10 rapid response teams for surveillance. These teams will work to sanitize any infected areas in the wards.
