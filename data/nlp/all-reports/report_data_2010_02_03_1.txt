H5N1 in Poultry in Bangladesh
District veterinarians culled 3,000 chickens on a farm in the Sirajganj district following detection of bird flu and a report to district livestock officials.  At first the disease was thought to be Ranikhet (a local term for Newcastle Disease), but after 2,000 birds died, tests were run and confirmed bird flu. According to the local livestock office, about 10,000 birds in the Sadar Upazila reportedly died of Ranikhet between Jan. 10-20, but tests were not carried out to confirm the disease, so there is concern that those birds may have died from bird flu as well.
