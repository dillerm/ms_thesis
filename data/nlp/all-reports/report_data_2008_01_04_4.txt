H5N1 in Poultry in Benin
Two new outbreaks of H5N1 have been reported in Benin. H5N1 has been detected from birds in a mixed flock of turkeys, guinea fowl, ducks and chickens that died in Akonaboe-Zebe, Porto Novo province. According to a report to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), only ducks and turkeys had died. In the second outbreak, at the village of Dogla, Dangbo province, nine chickens died in a "traditionally reared" mixed flock of chickens, ducks and turkeys. Both incidences are believed to have originated from an earlier outbreak at Akpro-Misserete province.
