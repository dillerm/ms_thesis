Hungary (HPAI H5N8)
According to a World Organisation for Animal Health report, fattening ducks at a farm in Fuzesgyyarmat, Bekes County with 2,170 birds tested positive for the highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus.  Preliminary results suggest that the virus is closely related to the recent Eurasian H5N8 viruses.  To prevent further spread of the disease, all of the birds in the affected holding and in three nearby holdings will be killed and destroyed, and the areas thoroughly disinfected.
