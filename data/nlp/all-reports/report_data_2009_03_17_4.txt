H5N1 in Poultry in Hong Kong
A second chicken, this time found floating in the sea off the outlying island of Tung Ping Chau in Hong Kong has tested positive for H5N1. Previously another chicken  found on the island had tested positive on Mar 6. Both birds were recovered on Mar. 3, but it took until this week for testing of the second sample to be completed.
