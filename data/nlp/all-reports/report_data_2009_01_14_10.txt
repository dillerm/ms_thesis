H5N1 in Humans in Vietnam
An 8 year-old girl has been infected with H5N1 avian influenza in Thanh Hoa Province. The girl and her family ate four ducks and three chickens from the neighborhood that tested positive for bird flu, and she was hospitalized in early January where she is now recovering, said the head of the provincial Animal Health Department, Nguyen Huu Dinh. In addition to the 8 year old, her 13-year-old sister died on January 2nd from similar symptoms. Their father said that the elder sister had a high fever and difficulty breathing on December 25th, 2008 and was taken to the provincial hospital where she later died. "We suspect that it was bird flu that caused her death," said the director of the Ba Thuoc district hospital. She also had eaten the poultry raised by the family prior to developing the symptoms. Vietnam?s Agriculture Ministry has since confirmed that some 400 chickens have died from H5N1 in Thanh Hoa, with the virus affecting six villages in the district. The official OIE report lists 383 birds dead and 7,800 destroyed in an outbreak. These announcements come just after the Vietnamese government said that there was a 70% decrease in dead and culled poultry in 2008 as compared with 2007, and the only province yet to be declared bird flu-free was Thai Nguyen. Bui Quang Anh, Head of the Veterinary Department said that no bird flu was detected in a large extent in 2008 and the only outbreaks happened at farms with unvaccinated poultry.
