H5N1 in Wild birds in UK
Major changes have been made in the Wild Bird Survey, the program responsible, in part, for avian influenza surveillance. Wild bird biologists and park wardens will monitor live and dead wild birds at designated reserves year round for bird flu; however, birds shot during the hunting season will no longer be tested. The changes are based on improved scientific understanding and experience since the Survey began in 2005. Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs chief veterinarian, Nigel Gibbens, said the survey will be kept under review and will be updated as necessary.
