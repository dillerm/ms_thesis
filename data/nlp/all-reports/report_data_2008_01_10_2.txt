H5N1 in Wild birds in United Kingdom
The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) confirmed on January 10 that three wild mute swans found dead on a nature reserve in Chesil Beach, Dorset (southwest England) have tested positive for H5N1. Media reports said tests were under way to determine whether the virus has infected other birds and ducks at a bird sanctuary, in Abbotsbury, Dorset. John Houston, in charge of Abbotsbury Swannery, told BBC News 24 television: "We are working closely with DEFRA to ensure that this outbreak is contained and that the swans affected remain low."
