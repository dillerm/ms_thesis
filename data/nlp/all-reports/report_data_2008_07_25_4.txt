H5N1 in Poultry in UK
The British Poultry Council has released guidelines for turkey producers aimed at reducing risk for bird flu. BPC's executive officer, Jeremy Blackburn, noted "The two major 2007 outbreaks in free-range turkey flocks were almost certainly caused by contact with wild ducks and geese." The guidelines state that free-range producers should have provisions in place to house their entire flock indoors, perhaps in simple temporary shelters made from straw bales and netting. These measures are intended to further protect Britain and its inhabitants from bird flu, which has been present in the country since October 2005.
