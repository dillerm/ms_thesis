Cambodia (H5N1)
A joint statement by the World Health Organization and the Cambodian Health Ministry on July 2 reported that a six-year-old girl from Southwestern Kampot province had died from H5N1 bird flu. Tests by the Institut Pasteur du Cambodge confirmed on June 28 that the patient was positive for H5N1 bird flu. She had developed a fever and headache on June 24 and her condition worsened with cough and dyspnea. The girl was first taken to a private clinic and was moved to Kantha Bopha Hospital on June 28. At the hospital she was treated with Tamiflu, but she died later that night. There have been recent poultry deaths in her village and it is likely that she was exposed to sick and dead poultry. "Avian influenza H5N1 remains a serious threat to the health of all Cambodians. This is the 13th case of H5N1 infection in humans this year," Health Minister Mam Bunheng said in the statement. He added, "I urge parents and guardians to keep children away from sick or dead poultry and prevent them from playing with chickens and ducks. Parents and guardians must also make sure children wash their hands with soap and water after any contact with poultry." Of the 13 cases in Cambodia this year, only four people have survived.
