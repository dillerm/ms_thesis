H5N1 in Wild birds in Germany
Three outbreaks in backyard flocks in December 2007 that were initially attributed to contact with wild birds have been found to be infected from the use of raw poultry offal that was infected with H5N1, according to a paper published in Emerging Infectious Diseases this month. The offal came from frozen duck carcasses from a commercial farm that was infected with H5N1 in July 2007. Some of the same flock had been sold in supermarkets for human consumption.
