Denmark
Samples taken from a farm in eastern Denmark during routine surveillance tested positive for low pathogenic H7 bird flu. The outbreak began on March 5 and was confirmed by testing at the National Veterinary Institute on March 9, but the source of the infection is unknown. The farm held 190 mallards and 5 chickens, all of which have been culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Other measures including quarantine, movement control, and zoning have already been taken and there are plans to disinfect the premises.
