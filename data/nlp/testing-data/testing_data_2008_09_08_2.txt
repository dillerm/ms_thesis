H5N1 in Poultry in USA
Two pheasants from a game farm in the Treasure Valley region of southwestern Idaho tested positive for low pathogenic avian influenza.  The virus was detected when the birds were sent to a diagnostic laboratory for a suspected bacterial infection.  Prior  to the diagnosis, 300 birds from the farm had been shipped to a bird dog sporting event in Chino, California.  All of the birds were quarantined and destroyed, and the transporting truck was disinfected.  The game farm supplies ducks, pheasants, chukar partridges, and quail for hunting events. All birds at the farm will be destroyed and the premise disinfected.
