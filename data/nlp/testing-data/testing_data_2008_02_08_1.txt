H5N1 in Wild birds in Hong Kong.
The black-crowned night heron found dead on Jan 28 was infected with H5N1. In addition, the Mai Po bird sanctuary will be closed to the puiblic for three weeks following the discovery of a great egret (Casmerodius albus) which is suspected of dying from bird flu. The bird has tested positive for H5 avian influenza and further testing is in progress. The reserve was also closed in December following the discovery of a grey heron infected with H5N1. In 2006, a total of 21 wild birds infected with H5N1 were detected in Hong Kong.
