Spain (HPAI H5N8)
The World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) reports a new outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza in Catalonia, northeastern Spain.  On February 20, a white stork was found dead in a natural park; testing confirmed the presence of H5N8.  Earlier in January, two greylag geese found dead in Castilla y Leon province had tested positive for HPAI H5N8. The detection of the virus in the stork came as the same time as an outbreak in poultry (see below). Passive surveillance and biosecurity measures have been strengthened; no other control measures were enacted. On February 23, the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock, Fisheries & Food in Catalonia (northeastern Spain) reported that highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza was found at a duck farm in the Catalonian province of Girona.  As a precautionary measure, all 17,327 ducks at the affected farm have been culled and all farms within a 3-kilometer protection zone will be inspected.  The source of the outbreak is suspected to be contact with migrating wild birds (a stork found dead in Catalonia on February 20 tested positive for H5N8; see above), and hunting of wild birds has been banned within 10 kilometers of the farm.  This is the first poultry outbreak of avian influenza in Spain this season.
