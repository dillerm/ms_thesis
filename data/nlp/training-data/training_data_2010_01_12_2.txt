H5N1 in Wild birds in India
At least a dozen migratory bar-headed geese were found dead on January 7 and 8 at Kaziranga National Park in Assam. The geese had recently arrived at the sanctuary from Siberia and officials are concerned that they may have died from bird flu. "A team of experts, including veterinarians, are carrying out post-mortems of the birds and samples will be sent to Bhopal to find out if the deaths were due to avian influenza or some other disease," a park ranger told the Indo-Asian News Service. Forest guards have been alerted to watch for other dead birds in the park, which contains 300 species of birds, 100 of which are migratory.
