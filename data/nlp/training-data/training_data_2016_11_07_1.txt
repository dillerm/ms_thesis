Hungary (HPAI H5N8)
National authorities have reported two cases of highly pathogenic H5N8 avian influenza virus. In Csongrad County, the disease was detected in a dead wild mute swan found on 10/19/16. It is unknown how the bird contracted the virus, but it is thought that wild bird migration may play a factor in the spread. In Bekes County, 2,374 birds have died on a farm with 10,201 118-days old fattening turkeys. HPAI H5N8 has been confirmed in the dead birds and the remainder of the flock will be destroyed. Indirect contact with wild birds is believed to have led to the introduction.
