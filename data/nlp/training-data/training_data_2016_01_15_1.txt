Taiwan (HPAI H5)
The Council of Agriculture (COA) in Taipei reported Taiwan's first cases of sparrows infected with the new H5 subtype of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus. Two dead sparrows picked up by a resident of Taichung's Situn District tested positive for the H5 subtype on January 8. Poultry farm operators and government agencies should remain alert to the possibility of sparrows transmitting avian influenza viruses among farms. To reduce this risk, authorities initiated disinfection of three farms within a 3 km radius of the area where the dead sparrows were collected. The COA also reported detection of one new H5 highly pathogenic subtype in a pigeon found dead on the roof of a residence in Taipei's Wenshan District on January 11. The source of the outbreak is unknown. Avian Influenza in Poultry
