USA (MN HPAI H5N2)
Officials at the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources said they have ruled out wild birds as a source of the highly pathogenic H5N2 avian influenza virus that affected a turkey flock Pope County earlier this month.  Migratory wildfowl were not in the area during the outbreak, and 148 fecal samples collected from resident wild birds were negative for the virus, eliminating wild birds as a potential cause.  Other experts disagree, arguing that the strain found in Pope County has the same makeup as strains found in other parts of the U.S. that came from wild birds and that the virus can?t be migrating among turkey populations, as it is highly lethal and would kill the birds.
