H5N1 in Poultry in India
More than 2,000 birds, including domestic poultry, were found dead in a village in Burdwan district and H5N1 bird flu is suspected. The State Animal Resources Development Department has sent in a team to collect samples, but results will not be ready for a few days. Narayan Biswas, state Animal Resource Development Minister, said, “There is no need to panic. The samples have been sent for testing. Birds have died, but there can be a number of reasons behind it. We are prepared to tackle any outbreak.”
