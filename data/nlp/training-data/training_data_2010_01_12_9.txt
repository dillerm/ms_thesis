On December 10, a spokesman for the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) confirmed that a nasal swab sample taken at a local pig farm on November 26 has tested positive for pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus. The farm is in the Yuen Long district and houses 1,200 pigs. None of the workers or pigs on the farm showed any clinical signs of flu. More samples have been taken from animals on the farm and their movement has been restricted. All of the more recent samples and others taken from nearby farms have tested negative so far. The AFCD will continue to monitor for the virus and will take samples from any animals with clinical symptoms. They have reminded farmers to stay vigilant, report problems, implement biosecurity measures, and practice good hygiene. In addition, they have distributed advisory letters on the prevention of H1N1 and implemented a human vaccination program on December 21, targeting those involved in farming and slaughtering pigs.
