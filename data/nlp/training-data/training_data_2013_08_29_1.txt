H7N7 Avian Influenza in Poultry in Italy
 According to the Italian veterinary authorities , three outbreaks of H7N7 have been confirmed at turkey farms in the Italian province of Ferrara.  Out of 19,850 susceptible turkeys, 1,300 birds died after contracting the virus.  The birds were first sampled on the 19th of August with negative results, but later tests confirmed the H7 virus.  To prevent the disease from spreading further, restriction zones have been established around the affected farms and the control measures being applied include quarantine, movement control throughout the country, and depopulation.
