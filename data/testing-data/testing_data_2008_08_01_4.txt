H5N1 in Poultry in Nigeria
Chickens and a duck from live-bird markets have tested positive for avian influenza. The chickens were found in the western state of Kebbi in June, and the duck was found in the eastern state of Gombe in July. The birds were tested as part of a routine surveillance procedure to find and eliminate H5N1 and officials have stated that the "available evidence so far suggests contact with wild birds may have led to the infection."
