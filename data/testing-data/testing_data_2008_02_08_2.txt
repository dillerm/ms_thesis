H5N1 in Wild birds in Bangladesh
Bird flu has spread to the capital Dhaka. “Dozens” of crows found dead over the last two days have tested positive for H5N1, the city’s authorities said. Authorities at the city’s zoo have beefed up biosecurity measures. Visitors must walk through an antiseptic footbath and bird cages are sprayed with disinfectants twice a day. Almost 10,000 people go through the park each day, but the Dhaka Zoo lake has little migratory bird traffic at this time of year, according to the deputy Curator of the Zoo, AKM Nazrul Islam. The zoo has 1,220 birds of 58 species in its collection.
