H5N1 in Wild birds in Singapore
A sixty year-old man was sentenced to four weeks in jail for smuggling wild birds from Indonesia to Singapore.  Officers from Agri-Food Veterinary Services caught the man at the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.  When apprehended, the man had thirty-three Oriental White Eyes wrapped in nylon netting and stuffed into the front pockets of his pants.  These small passerine birds usually are ten centimeters long when fully grown.  The smuggler confessed to an earlier event in April when he successfully brought in thirty-two birds. This is the first case of a jail sentence handed down in response to the possibility of AI transmission.
