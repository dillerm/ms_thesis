According to a statement from the White House, the declaration will allow medical facilities to waive some of the requirements of federal health insurance programs making it easier to deal with a rise in the number of flu patients. The CDC has reported that pandemic H1N1 (2009) has become widespread in 46 states. The declaration is a proactive measure in case care facilities become overburdened by future demands rather than a response to a new development. The Department of Health and Human Services is trying to deliver H1N1 vaccines but the availability has fallen short of projections because companies are having difficulty producing the vaccines. A pet ferret has tested positive for the pandemic 2009 H1N1 virus. A client brought a ferret with signs of respiratory illness and fever into a veterinary clinic in Portland, Oregon on October 5. The client’s family had recently experienced symptoms consistent with influenza so the veterinarians decided to test the ferret’s nasal secretions. On October 8 Oregon State University’s Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory presumptively diagnosed the ferret with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and their results were confirmed on October 9 by the National Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory.",
