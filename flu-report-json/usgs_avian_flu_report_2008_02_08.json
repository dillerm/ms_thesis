Nearly three million poultry have been destroyed by 5,000 workers in 800 teams working to contain the outbreak. As cullers finished their work, they were asked to self quarantine themselves before returning home. The culling operation was extended for two days, Feb. 3 and 4, announced Rahaman, because fresh cases of bird flu were reported in the Canning Block II of South 24 Parganas district. Precautionary culls will be performed in two districts in Assam province, adjacent to Parganas, but have not yet started in Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa."
