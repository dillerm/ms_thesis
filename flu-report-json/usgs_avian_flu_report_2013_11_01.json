	"content_1": "Chinese researchers recently conducted a study regarding last spring’s outbreak of H7N9 flu outbreak in southern China. According to the study, shutting down live poultry markets is 97 to 99 percent successful in preventing humans from contracting the virus. While only 135 human cases were confirmed during last spring’s outbreak, 45 of those cases resulted in fatalities. In most cases humans contracted the virus from infected birds, with only a few instances of humans passing the virus to humans. Live poultry markets are an ideal breeding ground for the virus, because of the crowded and unsanitary conditions. With the closing of the markets costing the economy an estimated $1.6 billion, other strategies of preventing outbreak besides mass extended closures are being explored. These may include instituting rest days in which the markets are closed for a day while they are disinfected, or a ban on leaving unsold poultry in markets from day to day.",

	"content_2": "The Cambodian Ministry of Health reported on October 31 a confirmed case of the H5N1 virus in the Battambang province. This is Cambodia’s 22nd H5N1 case in 2013. Cambodia has had 43 total confirmed cases of the H5N1 virus, with 32 of the cases having been children under 14 years of age. Of the 22 recent cases, 11 resulted in fatalities. The most recent case, a 6-year-old girl from Romdoul village in the Phnom Preuk district, is currently in stable condition; an ongoing investigation into the case found reports of recent chicken and duck deaths in the girl’s neighborhood and nearby villages. Officials hope that further investigation will provide more information about exactly how exposure of the virus occurred. A nationwide public health education campaign was recently launched; officials are specifically warning against the common practice of children handling poultry."
