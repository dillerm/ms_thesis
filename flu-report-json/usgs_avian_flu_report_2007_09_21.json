	"content_2": "On September 5, ducks began dying in a village near the city of Guangzhou; by September 13, over 13,830 ducks were reported dead. The Agriculture Ministry said that the detection of HPAI H5N1 has been confirmed by the National Avian Influenza Reference Laboratory. Over 153,00 ducks have been culled from nine villages within 3 km of the area to contain the outbreak. The ducks had been vaccinated, but did not receive a booster shot which would have increased its effectiveness from 65% to 90%, according to Yu Yedong, the director of Guangdong Animal Epidemic Prevention Center. The birds are suspected to have been exposed after the first shot. In nearby Hong Kong, the death of vaccinated duck raised fears that the virus has mutated and is no longer responding to the vaccine. Hong Kong has imposed a ban on the importation of poultry products from the entire Guangdong province for one week and a ban on import from the 20 farms within the 24 km radius of the index farm for three weeks. Live markets within 13 km of the area are also closed.",
