	"content_2": "The French Ministry of Agriculture has reported a case of highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 in Aveyron and two cases in Dordogne Departments last week as part of the monitoring strategy accompanied by increased vigilance of the actors in the poultry sector.  These outbreaks, which began in November of last year, have produced no fewer than 5 new strains of avian flu, including HPAI H5N1, H5N2, and H5N9, along with LPAI H5N2 and H5N3. All of these subtypes are described as being of European lineage and have not infected humans. They are also not descended from the more dangerous Asian H5N1 virus. In one of the outbreaks, H5N1 was reported on a farm in Dordogne housing a flock of ducks for fattening located in a range within a few hundred meters from a previously identified farm that had tested positive on 13 July 2016. The flock was detected through sampling within the framework of epidemiological investigations of this first outbreak in La Dornac. There were no clinical signs. The United Kingdom's Department of Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) said: \"These new cases suggest that disease is still circulating or that viral contamination is still present in certain areas.\".",
