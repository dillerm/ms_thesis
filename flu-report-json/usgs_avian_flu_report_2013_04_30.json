	"content_1": ".  The Nepalese Central Veterinary Laboratory and the National Bird Disease Research Laboratory confirmed earlier this week that the highly pathogenic avian flu (H1N1) virus had been detected at two poultry farms in the Chitwan District and one farm in the Rupandehi District.  The first farm in Godrang of Bharatpur, one of the largest in Chitwan, lost 30,000 out of 70,000 birds to the virus while an additional 11,289 were culled to prevent the disease from spreading further.  The second infected farm in the nearby village Mangalpur, has culled 3,200 birds and destroyed chicken feed and eggs in hopes to stop the disease from spreading.  Chitwan produces over 60% of the chickens for the country so officials are urging farmers to take necessary safety precautions.  The H1N1 virus was also confirmed at a farm in the Rupandehi District, where over 300 birds were destroyed after the Centre Veterinary Laboratory in Kathmandu confirmed the virus.",

	"content_4": ".  Officials from the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control, and Research in Dhaka, Bangladesh, are confirming that a one-year-old boy died of H5N1 on February 18, 2013.  Because the boy did not present with influenza-like or bird flu-like symptoms, throat and nasal samples were sent to the Center for Diseases Control in Atlanta, Georgia, and they confirmed the H151 virus on April 6th.  This is the country’s first human death from the deadly virus and officials are urging people to cook their chicken thoroughly, wash their hands after coming in contact with chickens and eggs, and for farmers to be diligent in following safety precautions.",

	"content_5": ".  Health officials in Taiwan confirmed on April 24, 2013, that a 53-year-old man has contracted H7N9, the new and dangerous strain of avian influenza.  This is the first case of H7N9 outside of mainland China, where 108 cases and 22 deaths have been reported.  The patient is extremely ill and is being treated in an isolation room.  The 139 people who had contact with him are also being closely monitored.  The patient, who frequently traveled between China and Taiwan, said he had not been exposed to poultry or uncooked poultry or eggs, making scientists wonder just how the virus is spread.Officials in neighboring countries remain on high alert now that the virus has left the mainland.  Japan and Hong Kong are making sure their safety measures are up-to-date to ensure they will be ready if the virus spreads.While there are still many unknowns about the H7N9 virus, Nancy Cox, the director of the influenza division at Centers for Disease Control, reported that the number of “new cases in Shanghai has seen a dramatic slowdown”, and that “the reduction in frequency of new cases is very encouraging\"."
