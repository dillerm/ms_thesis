The farm has biosecurity measures in place and its own restocking system, no new animals have been introduced since July 2008, and animals only leave the farm for slaughter. It is believed that farm workers who showed clinical signs of flu June 7 - 9 but did not seek medical care may have infected the pigs. The establishment was disinfected and the animals were quarantined to prevent the spread of H1N1. No animals have shown clinical signs of flu since June 24, but they are still being monitored.",

According to Hoang Van Nam, head of the Veterinary Department, an additional 1,300 birds were culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Deputy minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Diep Kinh Tan blamed the problem on a lack of disease prevention in some localities. He directed the Veterinary Department to handle the disease in Quang Ninh thoroughly and set up a quarantine center for poultry and livestock. In addition he urged localities nationwide to vaccinate flocks of ducks since they are especially prone to bird flu."
