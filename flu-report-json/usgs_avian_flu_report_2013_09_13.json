  "content_1": "The poultry industry in Nepal is reporting the closure of thousands of businesses and losses of over 7 billion rupees ($70 million USD) in the poultry sector, due to a recent outbreak of H5N1 in Kathmandu valley and other areas in Nepal. Consumer anxiety over rumors of the bird flu, rather than actual death of poultry, has caused the greatest blow to the poultry market in these areas. Businesspersons are predicting that with the poultry sector contributing nearly 4 percent of Nepal’s GDP, these losses will create a significant deficit in the country’s economy.",

  "content_2": "Italian officials are reporting another three outbreaks of H7N7, after farms in the provinces of Bologna and Ferrara recently confirmed the presence of the strain. This brings the total number of outbreaks to 6 since August 28, according to researchers in Legnaro, Italy. Two of the farms affected were commercial and are owned by the same company as in some of the earlier outbreaks, while the third outbreak occurred in a small backyard flock. About 220,000 birds were destroyed in the three locations to prevent the spread of the outbreak, compared to the 730,000 total destroyed during the previous three outbreaks. Control measures being applied include stamping out, screening, disinfection of affected areas, quarantine, movement control, and limitations on treatment and vaccination."
