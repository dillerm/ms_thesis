	"content_1": "A report published in Current Science (see below for the citation) on wild migratory birds and resident domestic birds by the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in India during the 2006-07 avian migratory season has found no evidence that wild birds were infected with influenza virus. The role of migratory birds in the spread of the H5N1 remains a subject of debate. According to Associate Professor Satish Pande, â€œThe hypothesis that migratory birds can transport HPAI H5N1 over long distances rests on the assumption that some infected, virus-shedding wild birds show no or only mild symptoms and migrate long distances unhampered.\" Researchers tested 1,986 fecal samples from 1,369 wild and 599 domestic birds. The birds sampled in the study did not test positive for H5N1 or any other influenza virus.",
