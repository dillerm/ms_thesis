	"content_1": "Recent research by scientists from China, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, and Indonesia has shown that outbreaks of H5N1 are closely related to the migration of wild birds. They presented their research at the fifth regional meeting of the Asian Partnership on Emerging Infectious Diseases Research (APEIR). According to Lei Fumin, researcher of Institute of Zoology with Chinese Academy of Sciences, the research team studied avian influenza outbreaks along the bird migration routes in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Their study indicated that outbreaks often coincide with migration patterns in time and location. Lakes and wetlands were found to be of particular importance in the transmission of influenza viruses. The research showed that the role of wild birds in the transmission of bird flu requires attention. Dr. Witthawat Wiriyarat from Thailand, who joined the research team, proposed to form a regional surveillance network to monitor avian influenza viruses in migratory birds. The discovery of large quantities of migratory bird carcasses in some of the lakes around the plateau in 2005 caused scientists to investigate the role of migratory birds in the transmission of bird flu.",

The district administration began a culling operation on January 14 to prevent the spread of the disease. The culling will take place within a 3-kilometer radius of the villages where the hens died and farmers will be compensated for culled birds. There are also twenty teams working on disinfection in ten villages. As a further precaution, the movement of poultry products in the area has been restricted. Between January 5 and January 15, over 1,000 hens and ducks died mysteriously in various villages in Murshidabad. Officials initially thought that the birds had died of cold and Ranikhet disease, but as the number of dying birds increased, they became concerned and decided to test for bird flu.",

	"content_3": ". The Livestock Service of South Lampung has announced a return of bird flu in the area. Three outbreaks of bird flu have occurred since the beginning of 2010, killing a total of 94 birds. According to the head of Animal Health and Veterinary Public Health of South Lampung, Agung Kusmartuti, the area is susceptible for bird flu transmission because it functions as a trading area with high activity and dense poultry movement. The Livestock Service has instituted control measures, including disinfection of chicken houses and raising public awareness. Seasonal effects may have caused the increase in bird flu prevalence, since this is the peak of the rainy season in Indonesia.",

	"content_5": ". A 17-year-old boy suspected of having contracted the H5N1 bird flu virus is in critical condition at the Arifin Achmad regional public hospital in Pekanbaru, Riau. According to the head of bird flu control, Azisman Saad, the patient is receiving intensive care in an isolated room but is still in a coma-like condition with a high fever. A sample has been sent for testing to confirm H5N1. It is not known how the patient was infected, but he began to show symptoms on January 15. The hospital recently cured a 4-year-old girl who had tested positive for H5N1 bird flu. She has fully recovered and has been moved from isolation to an ordinary ward for observation.",

	"content_6": "The Centers for Disease Control reported on January 15 that a boy from Iowa had contracted an H3N2 strain of swine flu that is different from both the pandemic H1N1 (2009) virus and seasonal H3N2 strains. An investigation showed no evidence of person-to-person transfer so the strain is not likely to spread. The boy caught the strain in September, but was not tested until November. He did not need to be hospitalized and recovered fully on his own. “While these cases are rare, they're not unheard of,\" Tom Skinner, a spokesman for the CDC, said, \"We do detect them from time to time and it's important for us to investigate, which happened in this case. And luckily there wasn't any evidence of sustained person-to-person transmission.\" It is not known how the boy contracted the virus.",

One of the two pigs that had originally fallen ill was slaughtered and the remaining pigs on the farm (12) were tested for infection. Nine pigs tested positive for antibodies to the virus and all of them tested negative for the virus. All of the pigs recovered fully within a few days. The origin of the outbreak is unknown."
