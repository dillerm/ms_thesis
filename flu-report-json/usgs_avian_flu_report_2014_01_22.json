	"content_1": ".   The South Korean Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs confirmed on January 20 that about 60 Baikal teal ducks died of H5N8 in Gochang, North Jeolla Province.  Lab results confirmed that it is the same strain that infected poultry farms throughout the province and led to the culling of 200,000 just days before.  Baikal teal ducks migrate from Sibera to South Korea in November for the winter, and due to the recent outbreaks, scientists believe that these ducks spread the virus to the neighboring farms.  Authorities remain on high alert and have banned the movement of poultry, farm workers, and veterinarians.",

In total, about 200,000 birds have been destroyed to prevent the disease from spreading. Additionally, a temporary lockdown was enforced at all poultry farms in North and South Jeolla provinces. “The provincial government is trying to find out the causes of the outbreaks, suspecting that migratory birds might have spread the virus.” This is the country’s first case of avian influenza since May 2011.",

	"content_6": ".  The number of H7N9 cases in China continues to grow.  Last week alone, Mainland China confirmed 14 new cases, 11 within a two-day span, including two deaths - one from a woman from Zhejiang province and the other from a man from Hong Kong who contracted the virus after visiting the Mainland.  The majority of the new cases are being seen in H7N9 “hot spots” in eastern China: Guangdong province, Zhejiang province, and the city of Shanghai.  Of the most recent cases, six are men and five are women ranging in ages from 28-78.  As of January 17, five were in critical condition, two were in severe condition, and three were in stable condition. With the Chinese New Year celebration just around the corner, Chinese health officials are on high alert as travel around the country is expected to increase substantially.  In hopes to minimize the number of new avian influenza cases, health officials are urging people, especially the elderly, to limit their contact with poultry.  Additionally, Hong Kong announced that they would begin conducting blood tests on all imported poultry to determine if they have the virus.  Any birds that test positive will be destroyed as well as those that have been in contact with infected birds.",

	"content_7": ".  In hopes to further advance H5N1 research, Canada’s National Microbiology Laboratory “has isolated live H5N1 virus from respiratory specimens taken from an Alberta woman who died recently from infection of that bird flu virus.”  The woman died on January 3 after contracting the virus during a three-week trip to China in December.  This was the first appearance of the virus in North America.  Scientists hope that by isolating the virus, they will be able to learn more about the virus and how it is spread, as the victim did not come in contact with poultry while in China.  Initial analysis of the strain shows that it resembles the H5N1 virus previously identified in China.",

Shanghai has confirmed seven avian influenza cases so far this year and officials are worried that the number may rise during the upcoming Chinese New Year celebration.  Gregory Hartl, a spokesman for the World Health Organization said “It’s always a concern when health workers die. Hospitals and other medical facilities are a flash point for human-to-human transmission. We would be very much wanting to follow up in as much detail as possible on this case.”",
